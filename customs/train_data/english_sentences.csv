"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.",english/english-sample1.wav,processed
"Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.",english/english-sample2.wav,processed
The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats.,english/english-sample3.wav,processed
"At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.",english/english-sample4.wav,processed
"It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features.",english/english-sample5.wav,processed
Winston made for the stairs.,english/english-sample6.wav,processed
It was no use trying the lift.,english/english-sample7.wav,processed
"Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours.",english/english-sample8.wav,processed
It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week.,english/english-sample9.wav,processed
"On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall.",english/english-sample11.wav,processed
It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move.,english/english-sample12.wav,processed
"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.",english/english-sample13.wav,processed
Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron.,english/english-sample14.wav,processed
The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall.,english/english-sample15.wav,processed
"Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable.",english/english-sample16.wav,processed
"The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely.",english/english-sample17.wav,processed
"His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.",english/english-sample19.wav,processed
"Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold.",english/english-sample20.wav,processed
The blackmoustachio’d face gazed down from every commanding corner.,english/english-sample22.wav,processed
There was one on the house-front immediately opposite.,english/english-sample23.wav,processed
"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston’s own.",english/english-sample24.wav,processed
"Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC.",english/english-sample25.wav,processed
"In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight.",english/english-sample26.wav,processed
"It was the police patrol, snooping into people’s windows.",english/english-sample27.wav,processed
"The patrols did not matter, however.",english/english-sample28.wav,processed
Only the Thought Police mattered.,english/english-sample29.wav,processed
Behind Winston’s back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan.,english/english-sample30.wav,processed
The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously.,english/english-sample31.wav,processed
"Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard.",english/english-sample32.wav,processed
There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment.,english/english-sample33.wav,processed
"How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork.",english/english-sample34.wav,processed
It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time.,english/english-sample35.wav,processed
But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to.,english/english-sample36.wav,processed
"You had to live — did live, from habit that became instinct — in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.",english/english-sample37.wav,processed
Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen.,english/english-sample38.wav,processed
"It was safer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing.",english/english-sample39.wav,processed
"A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape.",english/english-sample40.wav,processed
"This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste — this was London, chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania.",english/english-sample41.wav,processed
He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this.,english/english-sample42.wav,processed
"The Ministry of Truth --Minitrue, in Newspeak --was startlingly different from any other object in sight.",english/english-sample44.wav,processed
"It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air.",english/english-sample45.wav,processed
"From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party: WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.",english/english-sample46.wav,processed
"The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below.",english/english-sample47.wav,processed
Scattered about London there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size.,english/english-sample48.wav,processed
So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously.,english/english-sample49.wav,processed
They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided.,english/english-sample50.wav,processed
"The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts.",english/english-sample51.wav,processed
"The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war.",english/english-sample52.wav,processed
"The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order.",english/english-sample53.wav,processed
"And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs.",english/english-sample54.wav,processed
"Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.",english/english-sample55.wav,processed
The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one.,english/english-sample56.wav,processed
There were no windows in it at all.,english/english-sample57.wav,processed
"Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it.",english/english-sample58.wav,processed
"It was a place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests.",english/english-sample59.wav,processed
Winston turned round abruptly.,english/english-sample61.wav,processed
He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen.,english/english-sample62.wav,processed
He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen.,english/english-sample63.wav,processed
"By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow’s breakfast.",english/english-sample64.wav,processed
He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN.,english/english-sample65.wav,processed
"It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit.",english/english-sample66.wav,processed
"Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.",english/english-sample67.wav,processed
Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes.,english/english-sample68.wav,processed
"The next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful.",english/english-sample70.wav,processed
With the next he was more successful.,english/english-sample72.wav,processed
He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen.,english/english-sample73.wav,processed
For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position.,english/english-sample75.wav,processed
"Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window.",english/english-sample76.wav,processed
"To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves.",english/english-sample77.wav,processed
"By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went.",english/english-sample78.wav,processed
"He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen.",english/english-sample79.wav,processed
It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.,english/english-sample80.wav,processed
But it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer.,english/english-sample81.wav,processed
It was a peculiarly beautiful book.,english/english-sample82.wav,processed
"Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past.",english/english-sample83.wav,processed
"He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that.",english/english-sample84.wav,processed
He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty.,english/english-sample87.wav,processed
At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose.,english/english-sample88.wav,processed
He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase.,english/english-sample89.wav,processed
"Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession.",english/english-sample90.wav,processed
The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary.,english/english-sample91.wav,processed
"This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp.",english/english-sample92.wav,processed
Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off.,english/english-sample93.wav,processed
Actually he was not used to writing by hand.,english/english-sample95.wav,processed
"Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present purpose.",english/english-sample96.wav,processed
He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second.,english/english-sample97.wav,processed
A tremor had gone through his bowels.,english/english-sample98.wav,processed
To mark the paper was the decisive act.,english/english-sample99.wav,processed
"In small clumsy letters he wrote: April 4th, 1984.",english/english-sample100.wav,processed
He sat back.,english/english-sample101.wav,processed
A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him.,english/english-sample102.wav,processed
"To begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984.",english/english-sample103.wav,processed
"For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn.",english/english-sample105.wav,processed
"His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word doublethink.",english/english-sample106.wav,processed
For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him.,english/english-sample107.wav,processed
How could you communicate with the future? It was of its nature impossible.,english/english-sample108.wav,processed
For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper.,english/english-sample110.wav,processed
The telescreen had changed over to strident military music.,english/english-sample111.wav,processed
"It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say.",english/english-sample112.wav,processed
"For weeks past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage.",english/english-sample113.wav,processed
The actual writing would be easy.,english/english-sample114.wav,processed
"At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up.",english/english-sample116.wav,processed
"He dared not scratch it, because if he did so it always became inflamed.",english/english-sample118.wav,processed
The seconds were ticking by.,english/english-sample119.wav,processed
"He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the gin.",english/english-sample120.wav,processed
"Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down.",english/english-sample121.wav,processed
"His small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops: April 4th, 1984.",english/english-sample122.wav,processed
Last night to the flicks.,english/english-sample123.wav,processed
All war films.,english/english-sample124.wav,processed
One very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean.,english/english-sample125.wav,processed
Then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it.,english/english-sample127.wav,processed
Then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood.,english/english-sample130.wav,processed
He did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish.,english/english-sample132.wav,processed
"But the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down.",english/english-sample133.wav,processed
"It was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.",english/english-sample134.wav,processed
"It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so nebulous could be said to happen.",english/english-sample135.wav,processed
One of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors.,english/english-sample138.wav,processed
"He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction Department.",english/english-sample139.wav,processed
Presumably — since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner — she had some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines.,english/english-sample140.wav,processed
"She was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements.",english/english-sample141.wav,processed
Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her.,english/english-sample143.wav,processed
He knew the reason.,english/english-sample144.wav,processed
It was because of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her.,english/english-sample145.wav,processed
"He disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones.",english/english-sample146.wav,processed
But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most.,english/english-sample148.wav,processed
Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror.,english/english-sample149.wav,processed
The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police.,english/english-sample150.wav,processed
"That, it was true, was very unlikely.",english/english-sample151.wav,processed
"Still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him.",english/english-sample152.wav,processed
"The other person was a man named O’Brien, a member of the Inner Party and holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature.",english/english-sample153.wav,processed
A momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching.,english/english-sample154.wav,processed
"O’Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face.",english/english-sample155.wav,processed
In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner.,english/english-sample156.wav,processed
"He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming --in some indefinable way, curiously civilized.",english/english-sample157.wav,processed
Winston had seen O’Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years.,english/english-sample159.wav,processed
"Much more it was because of a secretly held belief --or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope --that O’Brien’s political orthodoxy was not perfect.",english/english-sample161.wav,processed
Something in his face suggested it irresistibly.,english/english-sample162.wav,processed
"And again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply intelligence.",english/english-sample163.wav,processed
But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone.,english/english-sample164.wav,processed
"Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so.",english/english-sample165.wav,processed
"At this moment O’Brien glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over.",english/english-sample166.wav,processed
"He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away.",english/english-sample167.wav,processed
"A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them.",english/english-sample168.wav,processed
The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.,english/english-sample169.wav,processed
It was a noise that set one’s teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one’s neck.,english/english-sample171.wav,processed
The Hate had started.,english/english-sample172.wav,processed
"As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had flashed on to the screen.",english/english-sample173.wav,processed
There were hisses here and there among the audience.,english/english-sample174.wav,processed
The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust.,english/english-sample175.wav,processed
"The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure.",english/english-sample177.wav,processed
"He was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party’s purity.",english/english-sample178.wav,processed
"Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room.",english/english-sample181.wav,processed
"He was an object of hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other.",english/english-sample183.wav,processed
Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him.,english/english-sample185.wav,processed
A day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police.,english/english-sample186.wav,processed
"The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be.",english/english-sample188.wav,processed
It was a book without a title.,english/english-sample190.wav,processed
"People referred to it, if at all, simply as the book.",english/english-sample191.wav,processed
But one knew of such things only through vague rumours.,english/english-sample192.wav,processed
Neither the Brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it.,english/english-sample193.wav,processed
In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy.,english/english-sample194.wav,processed
People were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen.,english/english-sample195.wav,processed
"The little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish.",english/english-sample196.wav,processed
Even O’Brien’s heavy face was flushed.,english/english-sample197.wav,processed
"He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave.",english/english-sample198.wav,processed
The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out “Swine! Swine! Swine!” and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen.,english/english-sample199.wav,processed
In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair.,english/english-sample201.wav,processed
"The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in.",english/english-sample202.wav,processed
Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary.,english/english-sample203.wav,processed
"And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.",english/english-sample205.wav,processed
"And yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to him to be true.",english/english-sample207.wav,processed
"It was even possible, at moments, to switch one’s hatred this way or that by a voluntary act.",english/english-sample209.wav,processed
"Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind.",english/english-sample211.wav,processed
He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon.,english/english-sample212.wav,processed
He would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian.,english/english-sample213.wav,processed
He would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax.,english/english-sample214.wav,processed
"Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her.",english/english-sample215.wav,processed
The Hate rose to its climax.,english/english-sample217.wav,processed
"The voice of Goldstein had become an actual sheep’s bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep.",english/english-sample218.wav,processed
Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying.,english/english-sample221.wav,processed
"It was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken.",english/english-sample222.wav,processed
"Then the face of Big Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the Party stood out in bold capitals: WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.",english/english-sample223.wav,processed
"But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone’s eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately.",english/english-sample224.wav,processed
The little sandy-haired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her.,english/english-sample225.wav,processed
With a tremulous murmur that sounded like “My Saviour!” she extended her arms towards the screen.,english/english-sample226.wav,processed
Then she buried her face in her hands.,english/english-sample227.wav,processed
It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer.,english/english-sample228.wav,processed
He could not help feeling a twinge of panic.,english/english-sample229.wav,processed
"He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless.",english/english-sample231.wav,processed
"Whether he wrote DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER, or whether he refrained from writing it, made no difference.",english/english-sample232.wav,processed
"Whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go on with it, made no difference.",english/english-sample233.wav,processed
The Thought Police would get him just the same.,english/english-sample234.wav,processed
"He had committed—would still have committed, even if he had never set pen to paper—the essential crime that contained all others in itself.",english/english-sample235.wav,processed
"Thoughtcrime, they called it.",english/english-sample236.wav,processed
Thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed for ever.,english/english-sample237.wav,processed
"You might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you.",english/english-sample238.wav,processed
It was always at night—the arrests invariably happened at night.,english/english-sample239.wav,processed
"In the vast majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest.",english/english-sample241.wav,processed
"People simply disappeared, always during the night.",english/english-sample242.wav,processed
"Your name was removed from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten.",english/english-sample243.wav,processed
"You were abolished, annihilated: vapourized was the usual word.",english/english-sample244.wav,processed
For a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria.,english/english-sample245.wav,processed
"He sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down the pen.",english/english-sample247.wav,processed
The next moment he started violently.,english/english-sample248.wav,processed
There was a knocking at the door.,english/english-sample249.wav,processed
"He sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt.",english/english-sample251.wav,processed
"But no, the knocking was repeated.",english/english-sample252.wav,processed
The worst thing of all would be to delay.,english/english-sample253.wav,processed
"His heart was thumping like a drum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless.",english/english-sample254.wav,processed
He got up and moved heavily towards the door.,english/english-sample255.wav,processed
As he put his hand to the door-knob Winston saw that he had left the diary open on the table.,english/english-sample256.wav,processed
"DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER was written all over it, in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room.",english/english-sample257.wav,processed
It was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done.,english/english-sample258.wav,processed
"But, he realized, even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet.",english/english-sample259.wav,processed
He drew in his breath and opened the door.,english/english-sample260.wav,processed
Instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him.,english/english-sample261.wav,processed
"A colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair and a lined face, was standing outside.",english/english-sample262.wav,processed
Do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink?,english/english-sample264.wav,processed
One had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face.,english/english-sample268.wav,processed
Winston followed her down the passage.,english/english-sample269.wav,processed
These amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation.,english/english-sample270.wav,processed
"Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were falling to pieces.",english/english-sample271.wav,processed
"The Parsons’ flat was bigger than Winston’s, and dingy in a different way.",english/english-sample276.wav,processed
"On the walls were scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, and a full-sized poster of Big Brother.",english/english-sample279.wav,processed
In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen.,english/english-sample281.wav,processed
“They haven’t been out today.,english/english-sample284.wav,processed
And of course--” She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle.,english/english-sample285.wav,processed
The kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage.,english/english-sample286.wav,processed
Winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the pipe.,english/english-sample287.wav,processed
"He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was always liable to start him coughing.",english/english-sample288.wav,processed
Parsons looked on helplessly.,english/english-sample290.wav,processed
"“Of course if Tom was home he’d put it right in a moment,” she said.",english/english-sample291.wav,processed
“He loves anything like that.,english/english-sample292.wav,processed
“Have you got a spanner?”,english/english-sample299.wav,processed
"said Winston, fiddling with the nut on the angle-joint.",english/english-sample300.wav,processed
"“I don’t know, I’m sure.",english/english-sample304.wav,processed
There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children charged into the living-room.,english/english-sample306.wav,processed
Parsons brought the spanner.,english/english-sample308.wav,processed
Winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe.,english/english-sample309.wav,processed
He cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room.,english/english-sample310.wav,processed
“Up with your hands!”,english/english-sample311.wav,processed
"Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies.",english/english-sample314.wav,processed
“You’re a traitor!”,english/english-sample316.wav,processed

"Suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting “Traitor!”",english/english-sample321.wav,processed
the little girl imitating her brother in every movement.,english/english-sample323.wav,processed
"It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters.",english/english-sample324.wav,processed
"It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston thought.",english/english-sample326.wav,processed
"Parsons’ eyes flitted nervously from Winston to the children, and back again.",english/english-sample328.wav,processed
In the better light of the living-room he noticed with interest that there actually was dust in the creases of her face.,english/english-sample329.wav,processed
"“They do get so noisy,”",english/english-sample330.wav,processed
she said.,english/english-sample331.wav,processed
"“They’re disappointed because they couldn’t go to see the hanging, that’s what it is.",english/english-sample332.wav,processed
I’m too busy to take them.,english/english-sample333.wav,processed
And Tom won’t be back from work in time.”,english/english-sample334.wav,processed
“Why can’t we go and see the hanging?”,english/english-sample335.wav,processed
roared the boy in his huge voice.,english/english-sample336.wav,processed
“Want to see the hanging!,english/english-sample337.wav,processed
"chanted the little girl, still capering round.",english/english-sample339.wav,processed
"Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the Park that evening, Winston remembered.",english/english-sample340.wav,processed
"This happened about once a month, and was a popular spectacle.",english/english-sample341.wav,processed
Children always clamoured to be taken to see it.,english/english-sample342.wav,processed
But he had not gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly painful blow.,english/english-sample345.wav,processed
It was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed into him.,english/english-sample346.wav,processed
But what most struck Winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman’s greyish face.,english/english-sample351.wav,processed
"Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen and sat down at the table again, still rubbing his neck.",english/english-sample352.wav,processed
The music from the telescreen had stopped.,english/english-sample353.wav,processed
"With those children, he thought, that wretched woman must lead a life of terror.",english/english-sample355.wav,processed
"Another year, two years, and they would be watching her night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy.",english/english-sample356.wav,processed
Nearly all children nowadays were horrible.,english/english-sample357.wav,processed
"On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it.",english/english-sample359.wav,processed
"The songs, the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the yelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother—it was all a sort of glorious game to them.",english/english-sample360.wav,processed
"All their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State, against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals.",english/english-sample361.wav,processed
It was almost normal for people over thirty to be frightened of their own children.,english/english-sample362.wav,processed
"And with good reason, for hardly a week passed in which the Times did not carry a paragraph describing how some eavesdropping little sneak—“child hero”",english/english-sample363.wav,processed
was the phrase generally used—had overheard some compromising remark and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.,english/english-sample364.wav,processed
"He picked up his pen half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to write in the diary.",english/english-sample366.wav,processed
Suddenly he began thinking of O’Brien again.,english/english-sample367.wav,processed
Years ago—how long was it?,english/english-sample368.wav,processed
Seven years it must be—he had dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-dark room.,english/english-sample369.wav,processed
"And someone sitting to one side of him had said as he passed: ‘We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.’ It was said very quietly, almost casually—a statement, not a command.",english/english-sample370.wav,processed
He had walked on without pausing.,english/english-sample371.wav,processed
"What was curious was that at the time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him.",english/english-sample372.wav,processed
It was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance.,english/english-sample373.wav,processed
But at any rate the identification existed.,english/english-sample375.wav,processed
It was O’Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.,english/english-sample376.wav,processed
Winston had never been able to feel sure—even after this morning’s flash of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O’Brien was a friend or an enemy.,english/english-sample377.wav,processed
Nor did it even seem to matter greatly.,english/english-sample378.wav,processed
"There was a link of understanding between them, more important than affection or partisanship.",english/english-sample379.wav,processed
"‘We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,’ he had said.",english/english-sample380.wav,processed
"Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it would come true.",english/english-sample381.wav,processed
The voice from the telescreen paused.,english/english-sample382.wav,processed
"A trumpet call, clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air.",english/english-sample383.wav,processed
The voice continued raspingly: “Attention!,english/english-sample384.wav,processed
"Your attention, please!",english/english-sample385.wav,processed
A newsflash has this moment arrived from the Malabar front.,english/english-sample386.wav,processed
Our forces in South India have won a glorious victory.,english/english-sample387.wav,processed
I am authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war within measurable distance of its end.,english/english-sample388.wav,processed
Here is the newsflash—”,english/english-sample389.wav,processed
"Bad news coming, thought Winston.",english/english-sample390.wav,processed
Winston belched again.,english/english-sample392.wav,processed
"The gin was wearing off, leaving a deflated feeling.",english/english-sample393.wav,processed
"The telescreen—perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to drown the memory of the lost chocolate—crashed into “Oceania, ’tis for thee”.",english/english-sample394.wav,processed
You were supposed to stand to attention.,english/english-sample395.wav,processed
"However, in his present position he was invisible.",english/english-sample396.wav,processed
"“Oceania, ’tis for thee”",english/english-sample397.wav,processed
gave way to lighter music.,english/english-sample398.wav,processed
"Winston walked over to the window, keeping his back to the telescreen.",english/english-sample399.wav,processed
The day was still cold and clear.,english/english-sample400.wav,processed
"Somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating roar.",english/english-sample401.wav,processed
About twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on London at present.,english/english-sample402.wav,processed
"Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and the word INGSOC fitfully appeared and vanished.",english/english-sample403.wav,processed
The sacred principles of Ingsoc.,english/english-sample405.wav,processed
"Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past.",english/english-sample406.wav,processed
"He felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster.",english/english-sample407.wav,processed
He was alone.,english/english-sample408.wav,processed
"The past was dead, the future was unimaginable.",english/english-sample409.wav,processed
What certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side?,english/english-sample410.wav,processed
And what way of knowing that the dominion of the Party would not endure for ever?,english/english-sample411.wav,processed
"Like an answer, the three slogans on the white face of the Ministry of Truth came back to him:",english/english-sample412.wav,processed
He took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket.,english/english-sample414.wav,processed
"There, too, in tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of the coin the head of Big Brother.",english/english-sample415.wav,processed
Even from the coin the eyes pursued you.,english/english-sample416.wav,processed
"On coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on the wrappings of a cigarette packet—everywhere.",english/english-sample417.wav,processed
Always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you.,english/english-sample418.wav,processed
"Asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed—no escape.",english/english-sample419.wav,processed
Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull.,english/english-sample420.wav,processed
"The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the Ministry of Truth, with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress.",english/english-sample421.wav,processed
His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape.,english/english-sample422.wav,processed
"It was too strong, it could not be stormed.",english/english-sample423.wav,processed
A thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down.,english/english-sample424.wav,processed
He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary.,english/english-sample425.wav,processed
"For the future, for the past—for an age that might be imaginary.",english/english-sample426.wav,processed
And in front of him there lay not death but annihilation.,english/english-sample427.wav,processed
The diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapour.,english/english-sample428.wav,processed
"Only the Thought Police would read what he had written, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory.",english/english-sample429.wav,processed
"How could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive?",english/english-sample430.wav,processed
The telescreen struck fourteen.,english/english-sample431.wav,processed
He must leave in ten minutes.,english/english-sample432.wav,processed
He had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty.,english/english-sample433.wav,processed
"Curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him.",english/english-sample434.wav,processed
He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear.,english/english-sample435.wav,processed
"But so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken.",english/english-sample436.wav,processed
It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage.,english/english-sample437.wav,processed
"He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote:",english/english-sample438.wav,processed
"To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone—to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone:",english/english-sample439.wav,processed
"From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of Big Brother, from the age of doublethink—greetings!",english/english-sample440.wav,processed
"He was already dead, he reflected.",english/english-sample441.wav,processed
"It seemed to him that it was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step.",english/english-sample442.wav,processed
The consequences of every act are included in the act itself.,english/english-sample443.wav,processed
He wrote:,english/english-sample444.wav,processed
Thoughtcrime does not entail death:,english/english-sample445.wav,processed
thoughtcrime IS death.,english/english-sample446.wav,processed
Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible.,english/english-sample447.wav,processed
Two fingers of his right hand were inkstained.,english/english-sample448.wav,processed
It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you.,english/english-sample449.wav,processed
"Some nosing zealot in the Ministry (a woman, probably:",english/english-sample450.wav,processed
He put the diary away in the drawer.,english/english-sample453.wav,processed
"It was quite useless to think of hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had been discovered.",english/english-sample454.wav,processed
A hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious.,english/english-sample455.wav,processed
Winston was dreaming of his mother.,english/english-sample457.wav,processed
"He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared.",english/english-sample458.wav,processed
"She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair.",english/english-sample459.wav,processed
"His father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered especially the very thin soles of his father’s shoes) and wearing spectacles.",english/english-sample460.wav,processed
The two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties.,english/english-sample461.wav,processed
"At this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms.",english/english-sample462.wav,processed
"He did not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes.",english/english-sample463.wav,processed
Both of them were looking up at him.,english/english-sample464.wav,processed
"They were down in some subterranean place—the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave—but it was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards.",english/english-sample465.wav,processed
"They were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening water.",english/english-sample466.wav,processed
"He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death, and they were down there because he was up here.",english/english-sample468.wav,processed
"He knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces.",english/english-sample469.wav,processed
"There was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things.",english/english-sample470.wav,processed
"He could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own.",english/english-sample471.wav,processed
"The thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his mother’s death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible.",english/english-sample473.wav,processed
"Tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason.",english/english-sample474.wav,processed
"Such things, he saw, could not happen today.",english/english-sample476.wav,processed
"Today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows.",english/english-sample477.wav,processed
"All this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.",english/english-sample478.wav,processed
The landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world.,english/english-sample480.wav,processed
In his waking thoughts he called it the Golden Country.,english/english-sample481.wav,processed
"It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there.",english/english-sample482.wav,processed
The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field.,english/english-sample485.wav,processed
With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside.,english/english-sample486.wav,processed
"Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him, indeed he barely looked at it.",english/english-sample487.wav,processed
What overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside.,english/english-sample488.wav,processed
That too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time.,english/english-sample490.wav,processed
Winston woke up with the word “Shakespeare”,english/english-sample491.wav,processed
But which buggers they didn’t ought to have trusted Winston could not now remember.,english/english-sample493.wav,processed
"Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war.",english/english-sample494.wav,processed
"For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly.",english/english-sample495.wav,processed
In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines.,english/english-sample498.wav,processed
"Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia.",english/english-sample499.wav,processed
But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control.,english/english-sample500.wav,processed
Officially the change of partners had never happened.,english/english-sample501.wav,processed
Oceania was at war with Eurasia:,english/english-sample502.wav,processed
therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.,english/english-sample503.wav,processed
"The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.",english/english-sample504.wav,processed
"If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happened—that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death?",english/english-sample506.wav,processed
The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance with Eurasia.,english/english-sample507.wav,processed
"He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia as short a time as four years ago.",english/english-sample508.wav,processed
But where did that knowledge exist?,english/english-sample509.wav,processed
"Only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated.",english/english-sample510.wav,processed
And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into history and became truth.,english/english-sample511.wav,processed
"“Who controls the past,”",english/english-sample512.wav,processed
"ran the Party slogan, “controls the future:",english/english-sample513.wav,processed
who controls the present controls the past.”,english/english-sample514.wav,processed
"And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered.",english/english-sample515.wav,processed
Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting.,english/english-sample516.wav,processed
It was quite simple.,english/english-sample517.wav,processed
All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory.,english/english-sample518.wav,processed
"“Reality control”, they called it:",english/english-sample519.wav,processed
"in Newspeak, ‘doublethink’.",english/english-sample520.wav,processed
Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air.,english/english-sample523.wav,processed
His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink.,english/english-sample524.wav,processed
"and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself.",english/english-sample526.wav,processed
That was the ultimate subtlety:,english/english-sample527.wav,processed
"consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed.",english/english-sample528.wav,processed
Even to understand the word “doublethink”,english/english-sample529.wav,processed
involved the use of doublethink.,english/english-sample530.wav,processed
The instructress had called them to attention again.,english/english-sample531.wav,processed
“And now let’s see which of us can touch our toes!”,english/english-sample532.wav,processed
she said enthusiastically.,english/english-sample533.wav,processed
"“Right over from the hips, please, comrades.",english/english-sample534.wav,processed
"Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing fit.",english/english-sample537.wav,processed
The half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations.,english/english-sample538.wav,processed
"The past, he reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed.",english/english-sample539.wav,processed
For how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory?,english/english-sample540.wav,processed
He tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother.,english/english-sample541.wav,processed
"He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain.",english/english-sample542.wav,processed
"In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days.",english/english-sample543.wav,processed
There was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented.,english/english-sample545.wav,processed
Winston could not even remember at what date the Party itself had come into existence.,english/english-sample546.wav,processed
Everything melted into mist.,english/english-sample548.wav,processed
"Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie.",english/english-sample549.wav,processed
"It was not true, for example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that the Party had invented aeroplanes.",english/english-sample550.wav,processed
He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood.,english/english-sample551.wav,processed
But you could prove nothing.,english/english-sample552.wav,processed
There was never any evidence.,english/english-sample553.wav,processed
Just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact.,english/english-sample554.wav,processed
And on that occasion—“Smith!”,english/english-sample555.wav,processed
"Bend lower, please!",english/english-sample559.wav,processed
You can do better than that.,english/english-sample560.wav,processed
You’re not trying.,english/english-sample561.wav,processed
"Lower, please!",english/english-sample562.wav,processed
"That’s better, comrade.",english/english-sample563.wav,processed
"Now stand at ease, the whole squad, and watch me.”",english/english-sample564.wav,processed
A sudden hot sweat had broken out all over Winston’s body.,english/english-sample565.wav,processed
His face remained completely inscrutable.,english/english-sample566.wav,processed
Never show dismay!,english/english-sample567.wav,processed
Never show resentment!,english/english-sample568.wav,processed
A single flicker of the eyes could give you away.,english/english-sample569.wav,processed
"“There, comrades!",english/english-sample571.wav,processed
That’s how I want to see you doing it.,english/english-sample572.wav,processed
Watch me again.,english/english-sample573.wav,processed
I’m thirty-nine and I’ve had four children.,english/english-sample574.wav,processed
Now look.”,english/english-sample575.wav,processed
She bent over again.,english/english-sample576.wav,processed
“You see my knees aren’t bent.,english/english-sample577.wav,processed
"You can all do it if you want to,”",english/english-sample578.wav,processed
she added as she straightened herself up.,english/english-sample579.wav,processed
“Anyone under forty-five is perfectly capable of touching his toes.,english/english-sample580.wav,processed
"We don’t all have the privilege of fighting in the front line, but at least we can all keep fit.",english/english-sample581.wav,processed
Remember our boys on the Malabar front!,english/english-sample582.wav,processed
And the sailors in the Floating Fortresses!,english/english-sample583.wav,processed
Just think what they have to put up with.,english/english-sample584.wav,processed
Now try again.,english/english-sample585.wav,processed
"That’s better, comrade, that’s much better,”",english/english-sample586.wav,processed
"she added encouragingly as Winston, with a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first time in several years.",english/english-sample587.wav,processed
Then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk.,english/english-sample589.wav,processed
In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices.,english/english-sample590.wav,processed
This last was for the disposal of waste paper.,english/english-sample592.wav,processed
"Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor.",english/english-sample593.wav,processed
For some reason they were nicknamed memory holes.,english/english-sample594.wav,processed
Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled.,english/english-sample596.wav,processed
They ran:,english/english-sample598.wav,processed
With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the fourth message aside.,english/english-sample600.wav,processed
It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last.,english/english-sample601.wav,processed
"The other three were routine matters, though the second one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures.",english/english-sample602.wav,processed
Winston dialled “back numbers”,english/english-sample603.wav,processed
"on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of the Times, which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes’ delay.",english/english-sample604.wav,processed
"The messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify.",english/english-sample605.wav,processed
"As it happened, the Eurasian Higher Command had launched its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone.",english/english-sample607.wav,processed
"It was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother’s speech, in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened.",english/english-sample608.wav,processed
"Today’s issue contained a statement of the actual output, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong.",english/english-sample610.wav,processed
Winston’s job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones.,english/english-sample611.wav,processed
"As for the third message, it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes.",english/english-sample612.wav,processed
"As short a time ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a “categorical pledge”",english/english-sample613.wav,processed
were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984.,english/english-sample614.wav,processed
"Actually, as Winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week.",english/english-sample615.wav,processed
All that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in April.,english/english-sample616.wav,processed
"As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of the Times and pushed them into the pneumatic tube.",english/english-sample617.wav,processed
"Then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames.",english/english-sample618.wav,processed
"What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms.",english/english-sample619.wav,processed
Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date.,english/english-sample622.wav,processed
"In no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken place.",english/english-sample625.wav,processed
"Books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made.",english/english-sample628.wav,processed
"always the reference was to slips, errors, misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy.",english/english-sample630.wav,processed
"But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the Ministry of Plenty’s figures, it was not even forgery.",english/english-sample631.wav,processed
It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another.,english/english-sample632.wav,processed
Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version.,english/english-sample634.wav,processed
A great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head.,english/english-sample635.wav,processed
"For example, the Ministry of Plenty’s forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs.",english/english-sample636.wav,processed
The actual output was given as sixty-two millions.,english/english-sample637.wav,processed
"Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled.",english/english-sample638.wav,processed
"In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions.",english/english-sample639.wav,processed
Very likely no boots had been produced at all.,english/english-sample640.wav,processed
"Likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared.",english/english-sample641.wav,processed
"All one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of Oceania went barefoot.",english/english-sample642.wav,processed
"And so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small.",english/english-sample643.wav,processed
"Everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain.",english/english-sample644.wav,processed
Winston glanced across the hall.,english/english-sample645.wav,processed
He had the air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen.,english/english-sample647.wav,processed
"He looked up, and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in Winston’s direction.",english/english-sample648.wav,processed
People in the Records Department did not readily talk about their jobs.,english/english-sample650.wav,processed
"There was a certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier.",english/english-sample653.wav,processed
"And this hall, with its fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one subsection, a single cell, as it were, in the huge complexity of the Records Department.",english/english-sample655.wav,processed
"Beyond, above, below, were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs.",english/english-sample656.wav,processed
"There was the tele-programmes section with its engineers, its producers, and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices.",english/english-sample658.wav,processed
There were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall.,english/english-sample659.wav,processed
"There were the vast repositories where the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed.",english/english-sample660.wav,processed
"And the Ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the Party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat.",english/english-sample663.wav,processed
"There was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally.",english/english-sample664.wav,processed
"Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while Winston was working, but they were simple matters, and he had disposed of them before the Two Minutes Hate interrupted him.",english/english-sample667.wav,processed
Winston’s greatest pleasure in life was in his work.,english/english-sample669.wav,processed
Winston was good at this kind of thing.,english/english-sample671.wav,processed
"On occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of the Times leading articles, which were written entirely in Newspeak.",english/english-sample672.wav,processed
He unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier.,english/english-sample673.wav,processed
It ran:,english/english-sample674.wav,processed
In Oldspeak (or standard English) this might be rendered:,english/english-sample676.wav,processed
Rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before filing.,english/english-sample678.wav,processed
Winston read through the offending article.,english/english-sample679.wav,processed
Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given.,english/english-sample682.wav,processed
"One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in disgrace, but there had been no report of the matter in the Press or on the telescreen.",english/english-sample683.wav,processed
"That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced.",english/english-sample684.wav,processed
"More commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the Party simply disappeared and were never heard of again.",english/english-sample686.wav,processed
One never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them.,english/english-sample687.wav,processed
In some cases they might not even be dead.,english/english-sample688.wav,processed
"Perhaps thirty people personally known to Winston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another.",english/english-sample689.wav,processed
Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip.,english/english-sample690.wav,processed
He raised his head for a moment:,english/english-sample692.wav,processed
again the hostile spectacle-flash.,english/english-sample693.wav,processed
It was perfectly possible.,english/english-sample695.wav,processed
So tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person:,english/english-sample696.wav,processed
"on the other hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place.",english/english-sample697.wav,processed
Very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually said.,english/english-sample698.wav,processed
Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced.,english/english-sample700.wav,processed
Perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence.,english/english-sample701.wav,processed
Perhaps Big Brother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordinate.,english/english-sample702.wav,processed
Perhaps Withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies.,english/english-sample703.wav,processed
Or perhaps—what was likeliest of all—the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government.,english/english-sample704.wav,processed
"The only real clue lay in the words “refs unpersons”, which indicated that Withers was already dead.",english/english-sample705.wav,processed
You could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested.,english/english-sample706.wav,processed
Sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed.,english/english-sample707.wav,processed
"Withers, however, was already an unperson.",english/english-sample709.wav,processed
He did not exist:,english/english-sample710.wav,processed
he had never existed.,english/english-sample711.wav,processed
Winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of Big Brother’s speech.,english/english-sample712.wav,processed
It was better to make it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject.,english/english-sample713.wav,processed
What was needed was a piece of pure fantasy.,english/english-sample715.wav,processed
Today he should commemorate Comrade Ogilvy.,english/english-sample718.wav,processed
"It was true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence.",english/english-sample719.wav,processed
"Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in Big Brother’s familiar style:",english/english-sample720.wav,processed
"The lesson—which is also one of the fundamental principles of Ingsoc—that,”",english/english-sample722.wav,processed
"At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter.",english/english-sample724.wav,processed
"At six—a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules—he had joined the Spies, at nine he had been a troop leader.",english/english-sample725.wav,processed
At eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies.,english/english-sample726.wav,processed
At seventeen he had been a district organizer of the Junior Anti-Sex League.,english/english-sample727.wav,processed
At twenty-three he had perished in action.,english/english-sample729.wav,processed
Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity and single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy’s life.,english/english-sample731.wav,processed
Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit:,english/english-sample734.wav,processed
in the end he decided against it because of the unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail.,english/english-sample735.wav,processed
Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle.,english/english-sample736.wav,processed
"There was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own.",english/english-sample738.wav,processed
"Comrade Ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact.",english/english-sample739.wav,processed
It struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones.,english/english-sample740.wav,processed
"In the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the lunch queue jerked slowly forward.",english/english-sample742.wav,processed
The room was already very full and deafeningly noisy.,english/english-sample743.wav,processed
"On the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall, where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.",english/english-sample745.wav,processed
"“Just the man I was looking for,”",english/english-sample746.wav,processed
said a voice at Winston’s back.,english/english-sample747.wav,processed
He turned round.,english/english-sample748.wav,processed
"It was his friend Syme, who worked in the Research Department.",english/english-sample749.wav,processed
Perhaps “friend”,english/english-sample750.wav,processed
was not exactly the right word.,english/english-sample751.wav,processed
"You did not have friends nowadays, you had comrades:",english/english-sample752.wav,processed
but there were some comrades whose society was pleasanter than that of others.,english/english-sample753.wav,processed
"Syme was a philologist, a specialist in Newspeak.",english/english-sample754.wav,processed
"Indeed, he was one of the enormous team of experts now engaged in compiling the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary.",english/english-sample755.wav,processed
"“I wanted to ask you whether you’d got any razor blades,”",english/english-sample757.wav,processed
he said.,english/english-sample758.wav,processed
“Not one!”,english/english-sample759.wav,processed
said Winston with a sort of guilty haste.,english/english-sample760.wav,processed
“I’ve tried all over the place.,english/english-sample761.wav,processed
They don’t exist any longer.”,english/english-sample762.wav,processed
Everyone kept asking you for razor blades.,english/english-sample763.wav,processed
Actually he had two unused ones which he was hoarding up.,english/english-sample764.wav,processed
There had been a famine of them for months past.,english/english-sample765.wav,processed
At any given moment there was some necessary article which the Party shops were unable to supply.,english/english-sample766.wav,processed
"Sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darning wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present it was razor blades.",english/english-sample767.wav,processed
"“I’ve been using the same blade for six weeks,”",english/english-sample770.wav,processed
he added untruthfully.,english/english-sample771.wav,processed
The queue gave another jerk forward.,english/english-sample772.wav,processed
As they halted he turned and faced Syme again.,english/english-sample773.wav,processed
Each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end of the counter.,english/english-sample774.wav,processed
“Did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?”,english/english-sample775.wav,processed
said Syme.,english/english-sample776.wav,processed
"“I was working,”",english/english-sample777.wav,processed
said Winston indifferently.,english/english-sample778.wav,processed
"“I shall see it on the flicks, I suppose.”",english/english-sample779.wav,processed
"“A very inadequate substitute,”",english/english-sample780.wav,processed
His mocking eyes roved over Winston’s face.,english/english-sample782.wav,processed
"“I know you,”",english/english-sample783.wav,processed
"the eyes seemed to say, “I see through you.",english/english-sample784.wav,processed
I know very well why you didn’t go to see those prisoners hanged.”,english/english-sample785.wav,processed
"In an intellectual way, Syme was venomously orthodox.",english/english-sample786.wav,processed
"Talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects and entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities of Newspeak, on which he was authoritative and interesting.",english/english-sample788.wav,processed
Winston turned his head a little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.,english/english-sample789.wav,processed
"“It was a good hanging,”",english/english-sample790.wav,processed
said Syme reminiscently.,english/english-sample791.wav,processed
“I think it spoils it when they tie their feet together.,english/english-sample792.wav,processed
I like to see them kicking.,english/english-sample793.wav,processed
"And above all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue—a quite bright blue.",english/english-sample794.wav,processed
That’s the detail that appeals to me.”,english/english-sample795.wav,processed
"“Nex’, please!”",english/english-sample796.wav,processed
yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle.,english/english-sample797.wav,processed
Winston and Syme pushed their trays beneath the grille.,english/english-sample798.wav,processed
"“There’s a table over there, under that telescreen,”",english/english-sample800.wav,processed
“Let’s pick up a gin on the way.”,english/english-sample802.wav,processed
The gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs.,english/english-sample803.wav,processed
"Winston took up his mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down.",english/english-sample805.wav,processed
When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was hungry.,english/english-sample806.wav,processed
Neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins.,english/english-sample808.wav,processed
"It had been on the tip of his tongue to say “Except the proles,”",english/english-sample810.wav,processed
"but he checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in some way unorthodox.",english/english-sample811.wav,processed
"Syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.",english/english-sample812.wav,processed
"“The proles are not human beings,”",english/english-sample813.wav,processed
he said carelessly.,english/english-sample814.wav,processed
"“By 2050—earlier, probably—all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared.",english/english-sample815.wav,processed
The whole literature of the past will have been destroyed.,english/english-sample816.wav,processed
Even the literature of the Party will change.,english/english-sample818.wav,processed
Even the slogans will change.,english/english-sample819.wav,processed
How could you have a slogan like ‘freedom is slavery’ when the concept of freedom has been abolished?,english/english-sample820.wav,processed
The whole climate of thought will be different.,english/english-sample821.wav,processed
"In fact there will be no thought, as we understand it now.",english/english-sample822.wav,processed
Orthodoxy means not thinking—not needing to think.,english/english-sample823.wav,processed
Orthodoxy is unconsciousness.”,english/english-sample824.wav,processed
"One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep conviction, Syme will be vaporized.",english/english-sample825.wav,processed
He is too intelligent.,english/english-sample826.wav,processed
He sees too clearly and speaks too plainly.,english/english-sample827.wav,processed
The Party does not like such people.,english/english-sample828.wav,processed
One day he will disappear.,english/english-sample829.wav,processed
It is written in his face.,english/english-sample830.wav,processed
Winston had finished his bread and cheese.,english/english-sample831.wav,processed
He turned a little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee.,english/english-sample832.wav,processed
At the table on his left the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away.,english/english-sample833.wav,processed
"From time to time Winston caught some such remark as “I think you’re so right, I do so agree with you,”",english/english-sample835.wav,processed
uttered in a youthful and rather silly feminine voice.,english/english-sample836.wav,processed
"But the other voice never stopped for an instant, even when the girl was speaking.",english/english-sample837.wav,processed
"Winston knew the man by sight, though he knew no more about him than that he held some important post in the Fiction Department.",english/english-sample838.wav,processed
"He was a man of about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth.",english/english-sample839.wav,processed
"His head was thrown back a little, and because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes.",english/english-sample840.wav,processed
"What was slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it was almost impossible to distinguish a single word.",english/english-sample841.wav,processed
"For the rest it was just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking.",english/english-sample843.wav,processed
"And yet, though you could not actually hear what the man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature.",english/english-sample844.wav,processed
"Whatever it was, you could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc.",english/english-sample846.wav,processed
"As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but some kind of dummy.",english/english-sample847.wav,processed
"It was not the man’s brain that was speaking, it was his larynx.",english/english-sample848.wav,processed
"The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech in the true sense:",english/english-sample849.wav,processed
"it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.",english/english-sample850.wav,processed
"Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew.",english/english-sample851.wav,processed
"The voice from the other table quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.",english/english-sample852.wav,processed
"“There is a word in Newspeak,”",english/english-sample853.wav,processed
"said Syme, “I don’t know whether you know it:",english/english-sample854.wav,processed
"duckspeak, to quack like a duck.",english/english-sample855.wav,processed
It is one of those interesting words that have two contradictory meanings.,english/english-sample856.wav,processed
"Applied to an opponent, it is abuse, applied to someone you agree with, it is praise.”",english/english-sample857.wav,processed
"Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again.",english/english-sample858.wav,processed
There was something subtly wrong with Syme.,english/english-sample860.wav,processed
There was something that he lacked:,english/english-sample861.wav,processed
"discretion, aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity.",english/english-sample862.wav,processed
You could not say that he was unorthodox.,english/english-sample863.wav,processed
"There was no law, not even an unwritten law, against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Café, yet the place was somehow ill-omened.",english/english-sample867.wav,processed
"The old, discredited leaders of the Party had been used to gather there before they were finally purged.",english/english-sample868.wav,processed
"Goldstein himself, it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago.",english/english-sample869.wav,processed
Syme’s fate was not difficult to foresee.,english/english-sample870.wav,processed
"And yet it was a fact that if Syme grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston’s, secret opinions, he would betray him instantly to the Thought Police.",english/english-sample871.wav,processed
"So would anybody else, for that matter:",english/english-sample872.wav,processed
but Syme more than most.,english/english-sample873.wav,processed
Zeal was not enough.,english/english-sample874.wav,processed
Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.,english/english-sample875.wav,processed
Syme looked up.,english/english-sample876.wav,processed
"“Here comes Parsons,”",english/english-sample877.wav,processed
he said.,english/english-sample878.wav,processed
"Something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, “that bloody fool.”",english/english-sample879.wav,processed
"At thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish.",english/english-sample881.wav,processed
In visualizing him one saw always a picture of dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms.,english/english-sample883.wav,processed
"He greeted them both with a cheery “Hullo, hullo!”",english/english-sample885.wav,processed
"and sat down at the table, giving off an intense smell of sweat.",english/english-sample886.wav,processed
Beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face.,english/english-sample887.wav,processed
His powers of sweating were extraordinary.,english/english-sample888.wav,processed
At the Community Centre you could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of the bat handle.,english/english-sample889.wav,processed
"Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a long column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his fingers.",english/english-sample890.wav,processed
"“Look at him working away in the lunch hour,”",english/english-sample891.wav,processed
"said Parsons, nudging Winston.",english/english-sample892.wav,processed
"What’s that you’ve got there, old boy?",english/english-sample894.wav,processed
"Something a bit too brainy for me, I expect.",english/english-sample895.wav,processed
"Smith, old boy, I’ll tell you why I’m chasing you.",english/english-sample896.wav,processed
It’s that sub you forgot to give me.”,english/english-sample897.wav,processed
“Which sub is that?”,english/english-sample898.wav,processed
"said Winston, automatically feeling for money.",english/english-sample899.wav,processed
"About a quarter of one’s salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions, which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them.",english/english-sample900.wav,processed
“For Hate Week.,english/english-sample901.wav,processed
You know—the house-by-house fund.,english/english-sample902.wav,processed
I’m treasurer for our block.,english/english-sample903.wav,processed
We’re making an all-out effort—going to put on a tremendous show.,english/english-sample904.wav,processed
"I tell you, it won’t be my fault if old Victory Mansions doesn’t have the biggest outfit of flags in the whole street.",english/english-sample905.wav,processed
Two dollars you promised me.”,english/english-sample906.wav,processed
"Winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which Parsons entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.",english/english-sample907.wav,processed
"“By the way, old boy,”",english/english-sample908.wav,processed
“I hear that little beggar of mine let fly at you with his catapult yesterday.,english/english-sample910.wav,processed
I gave him a good dressing-down for it.,english/english-sample911.wav,processed
In fact I told him I’d take the catapult away if he does it again.”,english/english-sample912.wav,processed
"“I think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,”",english/english-sample913.wav,processed
"“Ah, well—what I mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn’t it?",english/english-sample915.wav,processed
"All they think about is the Spies, and the war, of course.",english/english-sample917.wav,processed
"D’you know what that little girl of mine did last Saturday, when her troop was on a hike out Berkhamsted way?",english/english-sample918.wav,processed
"She got two other girls to go with her, slipped off from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man.",english/english-sample919.wav,processed
“What did they do that for?”,english/english-sample921.wav,processed
"said Winston, somewhat taken aback.",english/english-sample922.wav,processed
Parsons went on triumphantly:,english/english-sample923.wav,processed
"“My kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent—might have been dropped by parachute, for instance.",english/english-sample924.wav,processed
"But here’s the point, old boy.",english/english-sample925.wav,processed
What do you think put her on to him in the first place?,english/english-sample926.wav,processed
She spotted he was wearing a funny kind of shoes—said she’d never seen anyone wearing shoes like that before.,english/english-sample927.wav,processed
So the chances were he was a foreigner.,english/english-sample928.wav,processed
"Pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?”",english/english-sample929.wav,processed
“What happened to the man?”,english/english-sample930.wav,processed
"“Ah, that I couldn’t say, of course.",english/english-sample932.wav,processed
But I wouldn’t be altogether surprised if—”,english/english-sample933.wav,processed
"Parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue for the explosion.",english/english-sample934.wav,processed
"said Syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.",english/english-sample936.wav,processed
"“Of course we can’t afford to take chances,”",english/english-sample937.wav,processed
agreed Winston dutifully.,english/english-sample938.wav,processed
"“What I mean to say, there is a war on,”",english/english-sample939.wav,processed
"As though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the telescreen just above their heads.",english/english-sample941.wav,processed
"However, it was not the proclamation of a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the Ministry of Plenty.",english/english-sample942.wav,processed
cried an eager youthful voice.,english/english-sample944.wav,processed
We have glorious news for you.,english/english-sample946.wav,processed
We have won the battle for production!,english/english-sample947.wav,processed
Returns now completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the standard of living has risen by no less than 20 per cent over the past year.,english/english-sample948.wav,processed
Here are some of the completed figures.,english/english-sample950.wav,processed
"The phrase “our new, happy life”",english/english-sample952.wav,processed
recurred several times.,english/english-sample953.wav,processed
It had been a favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty.,english/english-sample954.wav,processed
"He could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction.",english/english-sample956.wav,processed
He had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco.,english/english-sample957.wav,processed
With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top.,english/english-sample958.wav,processed
Winston was smoking a Victory Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal.,english/english-sample959.wav,processed
The new ration did not start till tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left.,english/english-sample960.wav,processed
For the moment he had shut his ears to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the telescreen.,english/english-sample961.wav,processed
It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank Big Brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week.,english/english-sample962.wav,processed
"And only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grammes a week.",english/english-sample963.wav,processed
"Was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours?",english/english-sample964.wav,processed
"Yes, they swallowed it.",english/english-sample965.wav,processed
"Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal.",english/english-sample966.wav,processed
"The eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes.",english/english-sample967.wav,processed
"Syme, too—in some more complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it.",english/english-sample968.wav,processed
"Was he, then, alone in the possession of a memory?",english/english-sample969.wav,processed
The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen.,english/english-sample970.wav,processed
"Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly upwards.",english/english-sample972.wav,processed
He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life.,english/english-sample974.wav,processed
Had it always been like this?,english/english-sample975.wav,processed
Had food always tasted like this?,english/english-sample976.wav,processed
He looked round the canteen.,english/english-sample977.wav,processed
"Always in your stomach and in your skin there was a sort of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something that you had a right to.",english/english-sample979.wav,processed
It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly different.,english/english-sample980.wav,processed
Why should one feel it to be intolerable unless one had some kind of ancestral memory that things had once been different?,english/english-sample983.wav,processed
He looked round the canteen again.,english/english-sample984.wav,processed
"Nearly everyone was ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform blue overalls.",english/english-sample985.wav,processed
"On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small, curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting suspicious glances from side to side.",english/english-sample986.wav,processed
"Actually, so far as he could judge, the majority of people in Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured.",english/english-sample988.wav,processed
It was curious how that beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries:,english/english-sample989.wav,processed
It was the type that seemed to flourish best under the dominion of the Party.,english/english-sample991.wav,processed
The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music.,english/english-sample992.wav,processed
"Parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.",english/english-sample993.wav,processed
"“The Ministry of Plenty’s certainly done a good job this year,”",english/english-sample994.wav,processed
he said with a knowing shake of his head.,english/english-sample995.wav,processed
"“By the way, Smith old boy, I suppose you haven’t got any razor blades you can let me have?”",english/english-sample996.wav,processed
"“Not one,”",english/english-sample997.wav,processed
“I’ve been using the same blade for six weeks myself.”,english/english-sample999.wav,processed
"“Ah, well—just thought I’d ask you, old boy.”",english/english-sample1000.wav,processed
"The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the Ministry’s announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever.",english/english-sample1003.wav,processed
Within two years those children would be denouncing her to the Thought Police.,english/english-sample1006.wav,processed
Parsons would be vaporized.,english/english-sample1008.wav,processed
Syme would be vaporized.,english/english-sample1009.wav,processed
Winston would be vaporized.,english/english-sample1010.wav,processed
O’Brien would be vaporized.,english/english-sample1011.wav,processed
"Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.",english/english-sample1012.wav,processed
The eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized.,english/english-sample1013.wav,processed
"And the girl with dark hair, the girl from the Fiction Department—she would never be vaporized either.",english/english-sample1015.wav,processed
It seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish:,english/english-sample1016.wav,processed
"though just what it was that made for survival, it was not easy to say.",english/english-sample1017.wav,processed
The girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking at him.,english/english-sample1019.wav,processed
It was the girl with dark hair.,english/english-sample1020.wav,processed
"She was looking at him in a sidelong way, but with curious intensity.",english/english-sample1021.wav,processed
The instant she caught his eye she looked away again.,english/english-sample1022.wav,processed
The sweat started out on Winston’s backbone.,english/english-sample1023.wav,pending
A horrible pang of terror went through him.,english/english-sample1024.wav,pending
"It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness behind.",english/english-sample1025.wav,pending
Why was she watching him?,english/english-sample1026.wav,pending
Why did she keep following him about?,english/english-sample1027.wav,pending
"Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when he arrived, or had come there afterwards.",english/english-sample1028.wav,pending
"But yesterday, at any rate, during the Two Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to do so.",english/english-sample1029.wav,pending
Quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether he was shouting loudly enough.,english/english-sample1030.wav,pending
Winston was writing in his diary:,english/english-sample1031.wav,pending
It was three years ago.,english/english-sample1032.wav,pending
"It was on a dark evening, in a narrow side-street near one of the big railway stations.",english/english-sample1033.wav,pending
"She was standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light.",english/english-sample1034.wav,pending
"She had a young face, painted very thick.",english/english-sample1035.wav,pending
"It was really the paint that appealed to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips.",english/english-sample1036.wav,pending
Party women never paint their faces.,english/english-sample1037.wav,pending
"There was nobody else in the street, and no telescreens.",english/english-sample1038.wav,pending
She said two dollars.,english/english-sample1039.wav,pending
I—For the moment it was too difficult to go on.,english/english-sample1040.wav,pending
"He shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring.",english/english-sample1041.wav,pending
He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice.,english/english-sample1042.wav,pending
"Or to bang his head against the wall, to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window—to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him.",english/english-sample1043.wav,pending
"Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system.",english/english-sample1044.wav,pending
At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom.,english/english-sample1045.wav,pending
"He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back; a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five to forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case.",english/english-sample1046.wav,pending
They were a few metres apart when the left side of the man’s face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm.,english/english-sample1047.wav,pending
It happened again just as they were passing one another:,english/english-sample1048.wav,pending
"it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual.",english/english-sample1049.wav,pending
He remembered thinking at the time:,english/english-sample1050.wav,pending
That poor devil is done for.,english/english-sample1051.wav,pending
And what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious.,english/english-sample1052.wav,pending
The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep.,english/english-sample1053.wav,pending
"There was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.",english/english-sample1054.wav,pending
He drew his breath and went on writing:,english/english-sample1055.wav,pending
I went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen.,english/english-sample1056.wav,pending
"There was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the table, turned down very low.",english/english-sample1057.wav,pending
She—His teeth were set on edge.,english/english-sample1058.wav,pending
He would have liked to spit.,english/english-sample1059.wav,pending
"Simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine, his wife.",english/english-sample1060.wav,pending
"Winston was married—had been married, at any rate:",english/english-sample1061.wav,pending
"probably he still was married, so far as he knew his wife was not dead.",english/english-sample1062.wav,pending
"He seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because no woman of the Party ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so.",english/english-sample1063.wav,pending
Only the proles used scent.,english/english-sample1064.wav,pending
In his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication.,english/english-sample1065.wav,pending
When he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts.,english/english-sample1066.wav,pending
"Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break.",english/english-sample1067.wav,pending
"It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter.",english/english-sample1068.wav,pending
To be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour camp:,english/english-sample1069.wav,pending
"not more, if you had committed no other offence.",english/english-sample1070.wav,pending
"And it was easy enough, provided that you could avoid being caught in the act.",english/english-sample1071.wav,pending
The poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves.,english/english-sample1072.wav,pending
"Some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink.",english/english-sample1073.wav,pending
"Tacitly the Party was even inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed.",english/english-sample1074.wav,pending
"Mere debauchery did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class.",english/english-sample1075.wav,pending
The unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members.,english/english-sample1076.wav,pending
But—though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to—it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening.,english/english-sample1077.wav,pending
The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control.,english/english-sample1078.wav,pending
"Its real, undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act.",english/english-sample1079.wav,pending
"Not love so much as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it.",english/english-sample1080.wav,pending
"All marriages between Party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose, and—though the principle was never clearly stated—permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another.",english/english-sample1081.wav,pending
The only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the Party.,english/english-sample1082.wav,pending
"Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema.",english/english-sample1083.wav,pending
"This again was never put into plain words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from childhood onwards.",english/english-sample1084.wav,pending
"There were even organizations such as the Junior Anti-Sex League, which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes.",english/english-sample1085.wav,pending
"All children were to be begotten by artificial insemination (artsem, it was called in Newspeak) and brought up in public institutions.",english/english-sample1086.wav,pending
"This, Winston was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party.",english/english-sample1087.wav,pending
"The Party was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty it.",english/english-sample1088.wav,pending
"He did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so.",english/english-sample1089.wav,pending
"And as far as the women were concerned, the Party’s efforts were largely successful.",english/english-sample1090.wav,pending
He thought again of Katharine.,english/english-sample1091.wav,pending
"It must be nine, ten—nearly eleven years since they had parted.",english/english-sample1092.wav,pending
It was curious how seldom he thought of her.,english/english-sample1093.wav,pending
For days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married.,english/english-sample1094.wav,pending
They had only been together for about fifteen months.,english/english-sample1095.wav,pending
"The Party did not permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children.",english/english-sample1096.wav,pending
"Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid movements.",english/english-sample1097.wav,pending
"She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it.",english/english-sample1098.wav,pending
"Very early in her married life he had decided—though perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people—that she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had ever encountered.",english/english-sample1099.wav,pending
"She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party handed it out to her.",english/english-sample1100.wav,pending
“The human sound-track”,english/english-sample1101.wav,pending
he nicknamed her in his own mind.,english/english-sample1102.wav,pending
Yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing—sex.,english/english-sample1103.wav,pending
As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen.,english/english-sample1104.wav,pending
To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image.,english/english-sample1105.wav,pending
And what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength.,english/english-sample1106.wav,pending
The rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression.,english/english-sample1107.wav,pending
"She would lie there with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but submitting.",english/english-sample1108.wav,pending
"It was extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible.",english/english-sample1109.wav,pending
But even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate.,english/english-sample1110.wav,pending
But curiously enough it was Katharine who refused this.,english/english-sample1111.wav,pending
"They must, she said, produce a child if they could.",english/english-sample1112.wav,pending
"So the performance continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not impossible.",english/english-sample1113.wav,pending
"She even used to remind him of it in the morning, as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten.",english/english-sample1114.wav,pending
She had two names for it.,english/english-sample1115.wav,pending
"One was “making a baby,”",english/english-sample1116.wav,pending
and the other was “our duty to the Party”,english/english-sample1117.wav,pending
"(yes, she had actually used that phrase).",english/english-sample1118.wav,pending
Quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round.,english/english-sample1119.wav,pending
"But luckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards they parted.",english/english-sample1120.wav,pending
Winston sighed inaudibly.,english/english-sample1121.wav,pending
He picked up his pen again and wrote:,english/english-sample1122.wav,pending
"She threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up her skirt.",english/english-sample1123.wav,pending
"I—He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of Katharine’s white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party.",english/english-sample1124.wav,pending
Why did it always have to be like this?,english/english-sample1125.wav,pending
Why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years?,english/english-sample1126.wav,pending
But a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event.,english/english-sample1127.wav,pending
The women of the Party were all alike.,english/english-sample1128.wav,pending
Chastity was as deep ingrained in them as Party loyalty.,english/english-sample1129.wav,pending
"By careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the Youth League, by lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling had been driven out of them.",english/english-sample1130.wav,pending
"His reason told him that there must be exceptions, but his heart did not believe it.",english/english-sample1131.wav,pending
"They were all impregnable, as the Party intended that they should be.",english/english-sample1132.wav,pending
"And what he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it were only once in his whole life.",english/english-sample1133.wav,pending
"The sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion.",english/english-sample1134.wav,pending
Desire was thoughtcrime.,english/english-sample1135.wav,pending
"Even to have awakened Katharine, if he could have achieved it, would have been like a seduction, although she was his wife.",english/english-sample1136.wav,pending
But the rest of the story had got to be written down.,english/english-sample1137.wav,pending
He wrote:,english/english-sample1138.wav,pending
I turned up the lamp.,english/english-sample1139.wav,pending
When I saw her in the light—After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright.,english/english-sample1140.wav,pending
For the first time he could see the woman properly.,english/english-sample1141.wav,pending
"He had taken a step towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror.",english/english-sample1142.wav,pending
He was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here.,english/english-sample1143.wav,pending
It was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out:,english/english-sample1144.wav,pending
for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment.,english/english-sample1145.wav,pending
If he went away without even doing what he had come here to do—!,english/english-sample1146.wav,pending
"It had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed.",english/english-sample1147.wav,pending
What he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old.,english/english-sample1148.wav,pending
The paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask.,english/english-sample1149.wav,pending
"There were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open, revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness.",english/english-sample1150.wav,pending
She had no teeth at all.,english/english-sample1151.wav,pending
"He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:",english/english-sample1152.wav,pending
"When I saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years old at least.",english/english-sample1153.wav,pending
But I went ahead and did it just the same.,english/english-sample1154.wav,pending
He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again.,english/english-sample1155.wav,pending
"He had written it down at last, but it made no difference.",english/english-sample1156.wav,pending
The therapy had not worked.,english/english-sample1157.wav,pending
The urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever.,english/english-sample1158.wav,pending
"If there is hope, wrote Winston, it lies in the proles.",english/english-sample1159.wav,pending
"If there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 per cent of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated.",english/english-sample1160.wav,pending
The Party could not be overthrown from within.,english/english-sample1161.wav,pending
"Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another.",english/english-sample1162.wav,pending
"Even if the legendary Brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes.",english/english-sample1163.wav,pending
"Rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word.",english/english-sample1164.wav,pending
"But the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire.",english/english-sample1165.wav,pending
They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies.,english/english-sample1166.wav,pending
If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning.,english/english-sample1167.wav,pending
Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it?,english/english-sample1168.wav,pending
And yet—!,english/english-sample1169.wav,pending
He remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices—women’s voices—had burst from a side-street a little way ahead.,english/english-sample1170.wav,pending
"It was a great formidable cry of anger and despair, a deep, loud “Oh-o-o-o-oh!”",english/english-sample1171.wav,pending
that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell.,english/english-sample1172.wav,pending
His heart had leapt.,english/english-sample1173.wav,pending
It’s started!,english/english-sample1174.wav,pending
he had thought.,english/english-sample1175.wav,pending
A riot!,english/english-sample1176.wav,pending
The proles are breaking loose at last!,english/english-sample1177.wav,pending
"When he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship.",english/english-sample1178.wav,pending
But at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels.,english/english-sample1179.wav,pending
It appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans.,english/english-sample1180.wav,pending
"They were wretched, flimsy things, but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get.",english/english-sample1181.wav,pending
Now the supply had unexpectedly given out.,english/english-sample1182.wav,pending
"The successful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve.",english/english-sample1183.wav,pending
There was a fresh outburst of yells.,english/english-sample1184.wav,pending
"Two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another’s hands.",english/english-sample1185.wav,pending
"For a moment they were both tugging, and then the handle came off.",english/english-sample1186.wav,pending
Winston watched them disgustedly.,english/english-sample1187.wav,pending
"And yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats!",english/english-sample1188.wav,pending
Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered?,english/english-sample1189.wav,pending
He wrote:,english/english-sample1190.wav,pending
"Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious.",english/english-sample1191.wav,pending
"That, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription from one of the Party textbooks.",english/english-sample1192.wav,pending
"The Party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles from bondage.",english/english-sample1193.wav,pending
"Before the Revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age of six.",english/english-sample1194.wav,pending
"But simultaneously, true to the Principles of doublethink, the Party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules.",english/english-sample1195.wav,pending
In reality very little was known about the proles.,english/english-sample1196.wav,pending
It was not necessary to know much.,english/english-sample1197.wav,pending
"So long as they continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance.",english/english-sample1198.wav,pending
"Left to themselves, like cattle turned loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern.",english/english-sample1199.wav,pending
"They were born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty.",english/english-sample1200.wav,pending
"Heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbours, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizon of their minds.",english/english-sample1201.wav,pending
To keep them in control was not difficult.,english/english-sample1202.wav,pending
"A few agents of the Thought Police moved always among them, spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party.",english/english-sample1203.wav,pending
It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings.,english/english-sample1204.wav,pending
All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations.,english/english-sample1205.wav,pending
"And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances.",english/english-sample1206.wav,pending
The larger evils invariably escaped their notice.,english/english-sample1207.wav,pending
The great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes.,english/english-sample1208.wav,pending
Even the civil police interfered with them very little.,english/english-sample1209.wav,pending
"There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a whole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles themselves, it was of no importance.",english/english-sample1210.wav,pending
In all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code.,english/english-sample1211.wav,pending
The sexual puritanism of the Party was not imposed upon them.,english/english-sample1212.wav,pending
"Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce was permitted.",english/english-sample1213.wav,pending
"For that matter, even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it.",english/english-sample1214.wav,pending
They were beneath suspicion.,english/english-sample1215.wav,pending
As the Party slogan put it:,english/english-sample1216.wav,pending
“Proles and animals are free.”,english/english-sample1217.wav,pending
Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer.,english/english-sample1218.wav,pending
It had begun itching again.,english/english-sample1219.wav,pending
The thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the Revolution had really been like.,english/english-sample1220.wav,pending
He took out of the drawer a copy of a children’s history textbook which he had borrowed from Mrs.,english/english-sample1221.wav,pending
"Parsons, and began copying a passage into the diary:",english/english-sample1222.wav,pending
"In the old days (it ran), before the glorious Revolution, London was not the beautiful city that we know today.",english/english-sample1223.wav,pending
"It was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under.",english/english-sample1224.wav,pending
Children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water.,english/english-sample1225.wav,pending
But in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them.,english/english-sample1226.wav,pending
These rich men were called capitalists.,english/english-sample1227.wav,pending
"They were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page.",english/english-sample1228.wav,pending
"You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat.",english/english-sample1229.wav,pending
"This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was allowed to wear it.",english/english-sample1230.wav,pending
"The capitalists owned everything in the world, and everyone else was their slave.",english/english-sample1231.wav,pending
"They owned all the land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money.",english/english-sample1232.wav,pending
"If anyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to death.",english/english-sample1233.wav,pending
"When any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as “Sir”.",english/english-sample1234.wav,pending
"The chief of all the capitalists was called the King, and—But he knew the rest of the catalogue.",english/english-sample1235.wav,pending
"There would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in their ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the cat-o’-nine tails, the Lord Mayor’s Banquet, and the practice of kissing the Pope’s toe.",english/english-sample1236.wav,pending
"There was also something called the jus primae noctis, which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children.",english/english-sample1237.wav,pending
It was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories.,english/english-sample1238.wav,pending
How could you tell how much of it was lies?,english/english-sample1239.wav,pending
It might be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the Revolution.,english/english-sample1240.wav,pending
"The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different.",english/english-sample1241.wav,pending
"It struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness.",english/english-sample1242.wav,pending
"Life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the Party was trying to achieve.",english/english-sample1243.wav,pending
"Great areas of it, even for a Party member, were neutral and non-political, a matter of slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end.",english/english-sample1244.wav,pending
"The ideal set up by the Party was something huge, terrible, and glittering—a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons—a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting—three hundred million people all with the same face.",english/english-sample1245.wav,pending
"The reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories.",english/english-sample1246.wav,pending
"He seemed to see a vision of London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it was a picture of Mrs.",english/english-sample1247.wav,pending
"Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe.",english/english-sample1248.wav,pending
He reached down and scratched his ankle again.,english/english-sample1249.wav,pending
"Day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations—that they lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years ago.",english/english-sample1250.wav,pending
Not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved.,english/english-sample1251.wav,pending
"The Party claimed, for example, that today 40 per cent of adult proles were literate:",english/english-sample1252.wav,pending
"before the Revolution, it was said, the number had only been 15 per cent.",english/english-sample1253.wav,pending
"The Party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per thousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been 300—and so it went on.",english/english-sample1254.wav,pending
It was like a single equation with two unknowns.,english/english-sample1255.wav,pending
"It might very well be that literally every word in the history books, even the things that one accepted without question, was pure fantasy.",english/english-sample1256.wav,pending
"For all he knew there might never have been any such law as the jus primae noctis, or any such creature as a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat.",english/english-sample1257.wav,pending
Everything faded into mist.,english/english-sample1258.wav,pending
"The past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth.",english/english-sample1259.wav,pending
Just once in his life he had possessed—after the event:,english/english-sample1260.wav,pending
"that was what counted—concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification.",english/english-sample1261.wav,pending
He had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds.,english/english-sample1262.wav,pending
"In 1973, it must have been—at any rate, it was at about the time when he and Katharine had parted.",english/english-sample1263.wav,pending
But the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier.,english/english-sample1264.wav,pending
"The story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the Revolution were wiped out once and for all.",english/english-sample1265.wav,pending
"By 1970 none of them was left, except Big Brother himself.",english/english-sample1266.wav,pending
All the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counterrevolutionaries.,english/english-sample1267.wav,pending
"Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes.",english/english-sample1268.wav,pending
"Among the last survivors were three men named Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford.",english/english-sample1269.wav,pending
It must have been in 1965 that these three had been arrested.,english/english-sample1270.wav,pending
"As often happened, they had vanished for a year or more, so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way.",english/english-sample1271.wav,pending
"They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various trusted Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother which had started long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people.",english/english-sample1272.wav,pending
"After confessing to these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the Party, and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important.",english/english-sample1273.wav,pending
"All three had written long, abject articles in the Times, analysing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends.",english/english-sample1274.wav,pending
Some time after their release Winston had actually seen all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Café.,english/english-sample1275.wav,pending
He remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye.,english/english-sample1276.wav,pending
"They were men far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great figures left over from the heroic days of the Party.",english/english-sample1277.wav,pending
The glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them.,english/english-sample1278.wav,pending
"He had the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of Big Brother.",english/english-sample1279.wav,pending
"But also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two.",english/english-sample1280.wav,pending
No one who had once fallen into the hands of the Thought Police ever escaped in the end.,english/english-sample1281.wav,pending
They were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave.,english/english-sample1282.wav,pending
There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them.,english/english-sample1283.wav,pending
It was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people.,english/english-sample1284.wav,pending
They were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the café.,english/english-sample1285.wav,pending
"Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance had most impressed Winston.",english/english-sample1286.wav,pending
"Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the Revolution.",english/english-sample1287.wav,pending
"Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in the Times.",english/english-sample1288.wav,pending
"They were simply an imitation of his earlier manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing.",english/english-sample1289.wav,pending
"Always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes—slum tenements, starving children, street battles, capitalists in top hats—even on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats, an endless, hopeless effort to get back into the past.",english/english-sample1290.wav,pending
"He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy grey hair, his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips.",english/english-sample1291.wav,pending
"At one time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging, sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction.",english/english-sample1292.wav,pending
"He seemed to be breaking up before one’s eyes, like a mountain crumbling.",english/english-sample1293.wav,pending
It was the lonely hour of fifteen.,english/english-sample1294.wav,pending
Winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the café at such a time.,english/english-sample1295.wav,pending
The place was almost empty.,english/english-sample1296.wav,pending
A tinny music was trickling from the telescreens.,english/english-sample1297.wav,pending
"The three men sat in their corner almost motionless, never speaking.",english/english-sample1298.wav,pending
"Uncommanded, the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin.",english/english-sample1299.wav,pending
"There was a chessboard on the table beside them, with the pieces set out but no game started.",english/english-sample1300.wav,pending
"And then, for perhaps half a minute in all, something happened to the telescreens.",english/english-sample1301.wav,pending
"The tune that they were playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too.",english/english-sample1302.wav,pending
There came into it—but it was something hard to describe.,english/english-sample1303.wav,pending
"It was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note:",english/english-sample1304.wav,pending
in his mind Winston called it a yellow note.,english/english-sample1305.wav,pending
And then a voice from the telescreen was singing:,english/english-sample1306.wav,pending
Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me:,english/english-sample1307.wav,pending
"There lie they, and here lie we Under the spreading chestnut tree.",english/english-sample1308.wav,pending
The three men never stirred.,english/english-sample1309.wav,pending
"But when Winston glanced again at Rutherford’s ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears.",english/english-sample1310.wav,pending
"And for the first time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing at what he shuddered, that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.",english/english-sample1311.wav,pending
A little later all three were re-arrested.,english/english-sample1312.wav,pending
It appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release.,english/english-sample1313.wav,pending
"At their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new ones.",english/english-sample1314.wav,pending
"They were executed, and their fate was recorded in the Party histories, a warning to posterity.",english/english-sample1315.wav,pending
"About five years after this, in 1973, Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten.",english/english-sample1316.wav,pending
The instant he had flattened it out he saw its significance.,english/english-sample1317.wav,pending
"It was a half-page torn out of the Times of about ten years earlier—the top half of the page, so that it included the date—and it contained a photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York.",english/english-sample1318.wav,pending
"Prominent in the middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford.",english/english-sample1319.wav,pending
"There was no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom.",english/english-sample1320.wav,pending
The point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on Eurasian soil.,english/english-sample1321.wav,pending
"They had flown from a secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred with members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important military secrets.",english/english-sample1322.wav,pending
The date had stuck in Winston’s memory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well.,english/english-sample1323.wav,pending
There was only one possible conclusion:,english/english-sample1324.wav,pending
the confessions were lies.,english/english-sample1325.wav,pending
"Of course, this was not in itself a discovery.",english/english-sample1326.wav,pending
Even at that time Winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of.,english/english-sample1327.wav,pending
"But this was concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory.",english/english-sample1328.wav,pending
"It was enough to blow the Party to atoms, if in some way it could have been published to the world and its significance made known.",english/english-sample1329.wav,pending
He had gone straight on working.,english/english-sample1330.wav,pending
"As soon as he saw what the photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper.",english/english-sample1331.wav,pending
"Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen.",english/english-sample1332.wav,pending
He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible.,english/english-sample1333.wav,pending
"To keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort:",english/english-sample1334.wav,pending
"but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up.",english/english-sample1335.wav,pending
"He let what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the fear that some accident—a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for instance—would betray him.",english/english-sample1336.wav,pending
"Then, without uncovering it again, he dropped the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers.",english/english-sample1337.wav,pending
"Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes.",english/english-sample1338.wav,pending
That was ten—eleven years ago.,english/english-sample1339.wav,pending
"Today, probably, he would have kept that photograph.",english/english-sample1340.wav,pending
"It was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well as the event it recorded, was only memory.",english/english-sample1341.wav,pending
"Was the Party’s hold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which existed no longer had once existed?",english/english-sample1342.wav,pending
"But today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes, the photograph might not even be evidence.",english/english-sample1343.wav,pending
"Already, at the time when he made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and it must have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country.",english/english-sample1344.wav,pending
"Since then there had been other changes—two, three, he could not remember how many.",english/english-sample1345.wav,pending
Very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance.,english/english-sample1346.wav,pending
"The past not only changed, but changed continuously.",english/english-sample1347.wav,pending
What most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken.,english/english-sample1348.wav,pending
"The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the ultimate motive was mysterious.",english/english-sample1349.wav,pending
He took up his pen again and wrote:,english/english-sample1350.wav,pending
I understand HOW:,english/english-sample1351.wav,pending
I do not understand WHY.,english/english-sample1352.wav,pending
"He wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was a lunatic.",english/english-sample1353.wav,pending
Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one.,english/english-sample1354.wav,pending
"At one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today, to believe that the past is inalterable.",english/english-sample1355.wav,pending
"He might be alone in holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic.",english/english-sample1356.wav,pending
But the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him:,english/english-sample1357.wav,pending
the horror was that he might also be wrong.,english/english-sample1358.wav,pending
He picked up the children’s history book and looked at the portrait of Big Brother which formed its frontispiece.,english/english-sample1359.wav,pending
The hypnotic eyes gazed into his own.,english/english-sample1360.wav,pending
"It was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you—something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses.",english/english-sample1361.wav,pending
"In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it.",english/english-sample1362.wav,pending
It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later:,english/english-sample1363.wav,pending
the logic of their position demanded it.,english/english-sample1364.wav,pending
"Not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy.",english/english-sample1365.wav,pending
The heresy of heresies was common sense.,english/english-sample1366.wav,pending
"And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right.",english/english-sample1367.wav,pending
"For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four?",english/english-sample1368.wav,pending
Or that the force of gravity works?,english/english-sample1369.wav,pending
Or that the past is unchangeable?,english/english-sample1370.wav,pending
"If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable—what then?",english/english-sample1371.wav,pending
But no!,english/english-sample1372.wav,pending
His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord.,english/english-sample1373.wav,pending
"The face of O’Brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his mind.",english/english-sample1374.wav,pending
"He knew, with more certainty than before, that O’Brien was on his side.",english/english-sample1375.wav,pending
He was writing the diary for O’Brien—to O’Brien:,english/english-sample1376.wav,pending
"it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed to a particular person and took its colour from that fact.",english/english-sample1377.wav,pending
The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears.,english/english-sample1378.wav,pending
"It was their final, most essential command.",english/english-sample1379.wav,pending
"His heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand, much less answer.",english/english-sample1380.wav,pending
And yet he was in the right!,english/english-sample1381.wav,pending
They were wrong and he was right.,english/english-sample1382.wav,pending
"The obvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended.",english/english-sample1383.wav,pending
"Truisms are true, hold on to that!",english/english-sample1384.wav,pending
"The solid world exists, its laws do not change.",english/english-sample1385.wav,pending
"Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall towards the earth’s centre.",english/english-sample1386.wav,pending
"With the feeling that he was speaking to O’Brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote:",english/english-sample1387.wav,pending
Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.,english/english-sample1388.wav,pending
"If that is granted, all else follows.",english/english-sample1389.wav,pending
"From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee—real coffee, not Victory Coffee—came floating out into the street.",english/english-sample1390.wav,pending
Winston paused involuntarily.,english/english-sample1391.wav,pending
For perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world of his childhood.,english/english-sample1392.wav,pending
"Then a door banged, seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound.",english/english-sample1393.wav,pending
"He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcer was throbbing.",english/english-sample1394.wav,pending
This was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the Community Centre:,english/english-sample1395.wav,pending
"a rash act, since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked.",english/english-sample1396.wav,pending
"In principle a Party member had no spare time, and was never alone except in bed.",english/english-sample1397.wav,pending
"It was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation:",english/english-sample1398.wav,pending
"to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous.",english/english-sample1399.wav,pending
There was a word for it in Newspeak:,english/english-sample1400.wav,pending
"ownlife, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity.",english/english-sample1401.wav,pending
But this evening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air had tempted him.,english/english-sample1402.wav,pending
"The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre, the boring, exhausting games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable.",english/english-sample1403.wav,pending
"On impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered off into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, then north again, losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going.",english/english-sample1404.wav,pending
"“If there is hope,”",english/english-sample1405.wav,pending
"he had written in the diary, “it lies in the proles.”",english/english-sample1406.wav,pending
"The words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity.",english/english-sample1407.wav,pending
"He was somewhere in the vague, brown-coloured slums to the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station.",english/english-sample1408.wav,pending
He was walking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of ratholes.,english/english-sample1409.wav,pending
There were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles.,english/english-sample1410.wav,pending
"In and out of the dark doorways, and down narrow alley-ways that branched off on either side, people swarmed in astonishing numbers—girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years’ time, and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers.",english/english-sample1411.wav,pending
Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up.,english/english-sample1412.wav,pending
Most of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity.,english/english-sample1413.wav,pending
Two monstrous women with brick-red forearms folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway.,english/english-sample1414.wav,pending
Winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached.,english/english-sample1415.wav,pending
"“‘Yes,’ I says to ’er, ‘that’s all very well,’ I says.",english/english-sample1416.wav,pending
‘But if you’d of been in my place you’d of done the same as what I done.,english/english-sample1417.wav,pending
"It’s easy to criticize,’ I says, ‘but you ain’t got the same problems as what I got.’”",english/english-sample1418.wav,pending
"“Ah,”",english/english-sample1419.wav,pending
"said the other, “that’s jest it.",english/english-sample1420.wav,pending
That’s jest where it is.”,english/english-sample1421.wav,pending
The strident voices stopped abruptly.,english/english-sample1422.wav,pending
The women studied him in hostile silence as he went past.,english/english-sample1423.wav,pending
"But it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal.",english/english-sample1424.wav,pending
The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a street like this.,english/english-sample1425.wav,pending
"Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless you had definite business there.",english/english-sample1426.wav,pending
The patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them.,english/english-sample1427.wav,pending
"‘May I see your papers, comrade?",english/english-sample1428.wav,pending
What are you doing here?,english/english-sample1429.wav,pending
What time did you leave work?,english/english-sample1430.wav,pending
Is this your usual way home?’—and so on and so forth.,english/english-sample1431.wav,pending
Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route:,english/english-sample1432.wav,pending
but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Police heard about it.,english/english-sample1433.wav,pending
Suddenly the whole street was in commotion.,english/english-sample1434.wav,pending
There were yells of warning from all sides.,english/english-sample1435.wav,pending
People were shooting into the doorways like rabbits.,english/english-sample1436.wav,pending
"A young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back again, all in one movement.",english/english-sample1437.wav,pending
"At the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit, who had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston, pointing excitedly to the sky.",english/english-sample1438.wav,pending
“Steamer!”,english/english-sample1439.wav,pending
he yelled.,english/english-sample1440.wav,pending
"“Look out, guv’nor!",english/english-sample1441.wav,pending
Bang over’ead!,english/english-sample1442.wav,pending
Lay down quick!”,english/english-sample1443.wav,pending
“Steamer”,english/english-sample1444.wav,pending
"was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to rocket bombs.",english/english-sample1445.wav,pending
Winston promptly flung himself on his face.,english/english-sample1446.wav,pending
The proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind.,english/english-sample1447.wav,pending
"They seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound.",english/english-sample1448.wav,pending
Winston clasped his forearms above his head.,english/english-sample1449.wav,pending
There was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered on to his back.,english/english-sample1450.wav,pending
When he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window.,english/english-sample1451.wav,pending
He walked on.,english/english-sample1452.wav,pending
The bomb had demolished a group of houses 200 metres up the street.,english/english-sample1453.wav,pending
"A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins.",english/english-sample1454.wav,pending
"There was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak.",english/english-sample1455.wav,pending
When he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist.,english/english-sample1456.wav,pending
"Apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.",english/english-sample1457.wav,pending
"He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned down a side-street to the right.",english/english-sample1458.wav,pending
"Within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened.",english/english-sample1459.wav,pending
"It was nearly twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented (“pubs”, they called them) were choked with customers.",english/english-sample1460.wav,pending
"From their grimy swing doors, endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust, and sour beer.",english/english-sample1461.wav,pending
"In an angle formed by a projecting house-front three men were standing very close together, the middle one of them holding a folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulder.",english/english-sample1462.wav,pending
"Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces, Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies.",english/english-sample1463.wav,pending
It was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading.,english/english-sample1464.wav,pending
He was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation.,english/english-sample1465.wav,pending
For a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows.,english/english-sample1466.wav,pending
“Can’t you bleeding well listen to what I say?,english/english-sample1467.wav,pending
I tell you no number ending in seven ain’t won for over fourteen months!”,english/english-sample1468.wav,pending
"“Yes, it ’as, then!”",english/english-sample1469.wav,pending
"“No, it ’as not!",english/english-sample1470.wav,pending
Back ’ome I got the ’ole lot of ’em for over two years wrote down on a piece of paper.,english/english-sample1471.wav,pending
I takes ’em down reg’lar as the clock.,english/english-sample1472.wav,pending
"An’ I tell you, no number ending in seven—”",english/english-sample1473.wav,pending
"“Yes, a seven ’as won!",english/english-sample1474.wav,pending
I could pretty near tell you the bleeding number.,english/english-sample1475.wav,pending
"Four oh seven, it ended in.",english/english-sample1476.wav,pending
It were in February—second week in February.”,english/english-sample1477.wav,pending
“February your grandmother!,english/english-sample1478.wav,pending
I got it all down in black and white.,english/english-sample1479.wav,pending
"An’ I tell you, no number—”",english/english-sample1480.wav,pending
"“Oh, pack it in!”",english/english-sample1481.wav,pending
said the third man.,english/english-sample1482.wav,pending
They were talking about the Lottery.,english/english-sample1483.wav,pending
Winston looked back when he had gone thirty metres.,english/english-sample1484.wav,pending
"They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces.",english/english-sample1485.wav,pending
"The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention.",english/english-sample1486.wav,pending
It was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive.,english/english-sample1487.wav,pending
"It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant.",english/english-sample1488.wav,pending
"Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory.",english/english-sample1489.wav,pending
"There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets.",english/english-sample1490.wav,pending
"Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery, which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary.",english/english-sample1491.wav,pending
"Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being non-existent persons.",english/english-sample1492.wav,pending
"In the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.",english/english-sample1493.wav,pending
"“I arst you civil enough, didn’t I?”",english/english-sample1494.wav,pending
"said the old man, straightening his shoulders pugnaciously.",english/english-sample1495.wav,pending
“You telling me you ain’t got a pint mug in the ’ole bleeding boozer?”,english/english-sample1496.wav,pending
“And what in hell’s name is a pint?”,english/english-sample1497.wav,pending
"said the barman, leaning forward with the tips of his fingers on the counter.",english/english-sample1498.wav,pending
“Ark at ’im!,english/english-sample1499.wav,pending
Calls ’isself a barman and don’t know what a pint is!,english/english-sample1500.wav,pending
"Why, a pint’s the ’alf of a quart, and there’s four quarts to the gallon.",english/english-sample1501.wav,pending
"’Ave to teach you the A, B, C next.”",english/english-sample1502.wav,pending
"“Never heard of ’em,”",english/english-sample1503.wav,pending
said the barman shortly.,english/english-sample1504.wav,pending
“Litre and half litre—that’s all we serve.,english/english-sample1505.wav,pending
There’s the glasses on the shelf in front of you.”,english/english-sample1506.wav,pending
"“I likes a pint,”",english/english-sample1507.wav,pending
persisted the old man.,english/english-sample1508.wav,pending
“You could ’a drawed me off a pint easy enough.,english/english-sample1509.wav,pending
We didn’t ’ave these bleeding litres when I was a young man.”,english/english-sample1510.wav,pending
"“When you were a young man we were all living in the treetops,”",english/english-sample1511.wav,pending
"said the barman, with a glance at the other customers.",english/english-sample1512.wav,pending
"There was a shout of laughter, and the uneasiness caused by Winston’s entry seemed to disappear.",english/english-sample1513.wav,pending
The old man’s white-stubbled face had flushed pink.,english/english-sample1514.wav,pending
"He turned away, muttering to himself, and bumped into Winston.",english/english-sample1515.wav,pending
Winston caught him gently by the arm.,english/english-sample1516.wav,pending
“May I offer you a drink?”,english/english-sample1517.wav,pending
he said.,english/english-sample1518.wav,pending
"“You’re a gent,”",english/english-sample1519.wav,pending
"said the other, straightening his shoulders again.",english/english-sample1520.wav,pending
He appeared not to have noticed Winston’s blue overalls.,english/english-sample1521.wav,pending
“Pint!”,english/english-sample1522.wav,pending
he added aggressively to the barman.,english/english-sample1523.wav,pending
“Pint of wallop.”,english/english-sample1524.wav,pending
The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter.,english/english-sample1525.wav,pending
Beer was the only drink you could get in prole pubs.,english/english-sample1526.wav,pending
"The proles were supposed not to drink gin, though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough.",english/english-sample1527.wav,pending
"The game of darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets.",english/english-sample1528.wav,pending
Winston’s presence was forgotten for a moment.,english/english-sample1529.wav,pending
There was a deal table under the window where he and the old man could talk without fear of being overheard.,english/english-sample1530.wav,pending
"It was horribly dangerous, but at any rate there was no telescreen in the room, a point he had made sure of as soon as he came in.",english/english-sample1531.wav,pending
"“’E could ’a drawed me off a pint,”",english/english-sample1532.wav,pending
grumbled the old man as he settled down behind a glass.,english/english-sample1533.wav,pending
“A ’alf litre ain’t enough.,english/english-sample1534.wav,pending
It don’t satisfy.,english/english-sample1535.wav,pending
And a ’ole litre’s too much.,english/english-sample1536.wav,pending
It starts my bladder running.,english/english-sample1537.wav,pending
Let alone the price.”,english/english-sample1538.wav,pending
"“You must have seen great changes since you were a young man,”",english/english-sample1539.wav,pending
said Winston tentatively.,english/english-sample1540.wav,pending
"The old man’s pale blue eyes moved from the darts board to the bar, and from the bar to the door of the Gents, as though it were in the bar-room that he expected the changes to have occurred.",english/english-sample1541.wav,pending
"“The beer was better,”",english/english-sample1542.wav,pending
he said finally.,english/english-sample1543.wav,pending
“And cheaper!,english/english-sample1544.wav,pending
"When I was a young man, mild beer—wallop we used to call it—was fourpence a pint.",english/english-sample1545.wav,pending
"That was before the war, of course.”",english/english-sample1546.wav,pending
“Which war was that?”,english/english-sample1547.wav,pending
said Winston.,english/english-sample1548.wav,pending
"“It’s all wars,”",english/english-sample1549.wav,pending
said the old man vaguely.,english/english-sample1550.wav,pending
"He took up his glass, and his shoulders straightened again.",english/english-sample1551.wav,pending
“’Ere’s wishing you the very best of ’ealth!”,english/english-sample1552.wav,pending
"In his lean throat the sharp-pointed Adam’s apple made a surprisingly rapid up-and-down movement, and the beer vanished.",english/english-sample1553.wav,pending
Winston went to the bar and came back with two more half-litres.,english/english-sample1554.wav,pending
The old man appeared to have forgotten his prejudice against drinking a full litre.,english/english-sample1555.wav,pending
"“You are very much older than I am,”",english/english-sample1556.wav,pending
said Winston.,english/english-sample1557.wav,pending
“You must have been a grown man before I was born.,english/english-sample1558.wav,pending
"You can remember what it was like in the old days, before the Revolution.",english/english-sample1559.wav,pending
People of my age don’t really know anything about those times.,english/english-sample1560.wav,pending
"We can only read about them in books, and what it says in the books may not be true.",english/english-sample1561.wav,pending
I should like your opinion on that.,english/english-sample1562.wav,pending
The history books say that life before the Revolution was completely different from what it is now.,english/english-sample1563.wav,pending
"There was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty worse than anything we can imagine.",english/english-sample1564.wav,pending
"Here in London, the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death.",english/english-sample1565.wav,pending
Half of them hadn’t even boots on their feet.,english/english-sample1566.wav,pending
"They worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they slept ten in a room.",english/english-sample1567.wav,pending
"And at the same time there were a very few people, only a few thousands—the capitalists, they were called—who were rich and powerful.",english/english-sample1568.wav,pending
They owned everything that there was to own.,english/english-sample1569.wav,pending
"They lived in great gorgeous houses with thirty servants, they rode about in motor-cars and four-horse carriages, they drank champagne, they wore top hats—”",english/english-sample1570.wav,pending
The old man brightened suddenly.,english/english-sample1571.wav,pending
“Top ’ats!”,english/english-sample1572.wav,pending
he said.,english/english-sample1573.wav,pending
“Funny you should mention ’em.,english/english-sample1574.wav,pending
"The same thing come into my ’ead only yesterday, I dono why.",english/english-sample1575.wav,pending
"I was jest thinking, I ain’t seen a top ’at in years.",english/english-sample1576.wav,pending
"Gorn right out, they ’ave.",english/english-sample1577.wav,pending
The last time I wore one was at my sister-in-law’s funeral.,english/english-sample1578.wav,pending
"And that was—well, I couldn’t give you the date, but it must’a been fifty years ago.",english/english-sample1579.wav,pending
"Of course it was only ’ired for the occasion, you understand.”",english/english-sample1580.wav,pending
"“It isn’t very important about the top hats,”",english/english-sample1581.wav,pending
said Winston patiently.,english/english-sample1582.wav,pending
"“The point is, these capitalists—they and a few lawyers and priests and so forth who lived on them—were the lords of the earth.",english/english-sample1583.wav,pending
Everything existed for their benefit.,english/english-sample1584.wav,pending
"You—the ordinary people, the workers—were their slaves.",english/english-sample1585.wav,pending
They could do what they liked with you.,english/english-sample1586.wav,pending
They could ship you off to Canada like cattle.,english/english-sample1587.wav,pending
They could sleep with your daughters if they chose.,english/english-sample1588.wav,pending
They could order you to be flogged with something called a cat-o’-nine tails.,english/english-sample1589.wav,pending
You had to take your cap off when you passed them.,english/english-sample1590.wav,pending
Every capitalist went about with a gang of lackeys who—”,english/english-sample1591.wav,pending
The old man brightened again.,english/english-sample1592.wav,pending
“Lackeys!”,english/english-sample1593.wav,pending
he said.,english/english-sample1594.wav,pending
“Now there’s a word I ain’t ’eard since ever so long.,english/english-sample1595.wav,pending
Lackeys!,english/english-sample1596.wav,pending
"That reg’lar takes me back, that does.",english/english-sample1597.wav,pending
"I recollect oh, donkey’s years ago—I used to sometimes go to ’Yde Park of a Sunday afternoon to ’ear the blokes making speeches.",english/english-sample1598.wav,pending
"Salvation Army, Roman Catholics, Jews, Indians—all sorts there was.",english/english-sample1599.wav,pending
"And there was one bloke—well, I couldn’t give you ’is name, but a real powerful speaker ’e was.",english/english-sample1600.wav,pending
’E didn’t ’alf give it ’em!,english/english-sample1601.wav,pending
"‘Lackeys!’ ’e says, ‘lackeys of the bourgeoisie!",english/english-sample1602.wav,pending
Flunkies of the ruling class!’ Parasites—that was another of them.,english/english-sample1603.wav,pending
And ’yenas—’e definitely called ’em ’yenas.,english/english-sample1604.wav,pending
"Of course ’e was referring to the Labour Party, you understand.”",english/english-sample1605.wav,pending
"He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney-pots.",english/english-sample1606.wav,pending
Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to be lived in.,english/english-sample1607.wav,pending
"There was a strip of carpet on the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly arm-chair drawn up to the fireplace.",english/english-sample1608.wav,pending
An old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece.,english/english-sample1609.wav,pending
"Under the window, and occupying nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still on it.",english/english-sample1610.wav,pending
"“We lived here till my wife died,”",english/english-sample1611.wav,pending
said the old man half apologetically.,english/english-sample1612.wav,pending
“I’m selling the furniture off by little and little.,english/english-sample1613.wav,pending
"Now that’s a beautiful mahogany bed, or at least it would be if you could get the bugs out of it.",english/english-sample1614.wav,pending
But I dare say you’d find it a little bit cumbersome.”,english/english-sample1615.wav,pending
"He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illuminate the whole room, and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting.",english/english-sample1616.wav,pending
"The thought flitted through Winston’s mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk.",english/english-sample1617.wav,pending
"It was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral memory.",english/english-sample1618.wav,pending
"It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.",english/english-sample1619.wav,pending
“There’s no telescreen!”,english/english-sample1620.wav,pending
he could not help murmuring.,english/english-sample1621.wav,pending
"“Ah,”",english/english-sample1622.wav,pending
"said the old man, “I never had one of those things.",english/english-sample1623.wav,pending
Too expensive.,english/english-sample1624.wav,pending
"And I never seemed to feel the need of it, somehow.",english/english-sample1625.wav,pending
Now that’s a nice gateleg table in the corner there.,english/english-sample1626.wav,pending
Though of course you’d have to put new hinges on it if you wanted to use the flaps.”,english/english-sample1627.wav,pending
"There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and Winston had already gravitated towards it.",english/english-sample1628.wav,pending
It contained nothing but rubbish.,english/english-sample1629.wav,pending
The hunting-down and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in the prole quarters as everywhere else.,english/english-sample1630.wav,pending
It was very unlikely that there existed anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960.,english/english-sample1631.wav,pending
"The old man, still carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung on the other side of the fireplace, opposite the bed.",english/english-sample1632.wav,pending
"“Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all—”",english/english-sample1633.wav,pending
he began delicately.,english/english-sample1634.wav,pending
Winston came across to examine the picture.,english/english-sample1635.wav,pending
"It was a steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in front.",english/english-sample1636.wav,pending
"There was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was what appeared to be a statue.",english/english-sample1637.wav,pending
Winston gazed at it for some moments.,english/english-sample1638.wav,pending
"It seemed vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.",english/english-sample1639.wav,pending
"“The frame’s fixed to the wall,”",english/english-sample1640.wav,pending
"said the old man, “but I could unscrew it for you, I dare say.”",english/english-sample1641.wav,pending
"“I know that building,”",english/english-sample1642.wav,pending
said Winston finally.,english/english-sample1643.wav,pending
“It’s a ruin now.,english/english-sample1644.wav,pending
It’s in the middle of the street outside the Palace of Justice.”,english/english-sample1645.wav,pending
“That’s right.,english/english-sample1646.wav,pending
Outside the Law Courts.,english/english-sample1647.wav,pending
"It was bombed in—oh, many years ago.",english/english-sample1648.wav,pending
"It was a church at one time, St.",english/english-sample1649.wav,pending
"Clement’s Danes, its name was.”",english/english-sample1650.wav,pending
"He smiled apologetically, as though conscious of saying something slightly ridiculous, and added:",english/english-sample1651.wav,pending
"“Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St.",english/english-sample1652.wav,pending
Clement’s!”,english/english-sample1653.wav,pending
“What’s that?”,english/english-sample1654.wav,pending
said Winston.,english/english-sample1655.wav,pending
"“Oh—‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St.",english/english-sample1656.wav,pending
Clement’s.’ That was a rhyme we had when I was a little boy.,english/english-sample1657.wav,pending
"How it goes on I don’t remember, but I do know it ended up, ‘Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here comes a chopper to chop off your head.’ It was a kind of a dance.",english/english-sample1658.wav,pending
"They held out their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to ‘Here comes a chopper to chop off your head’ they brought their arms down and caught you.",english/english-sample1659.wav,pending
It was just names of churches.,english/english-sample1660.wav,pending
"All the London churches were in it—all the principal ones, that is.”",english/english-sample1661.wav,pending
Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged.,english/english-sample1662.wav,pending
It was always difficult to determine the age of a London building.,english/english-sample1663.wav,pending
"Anything large and impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically claimed as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle Ages.",english/english-sample1664.wav,pending
The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value.,english/english-sample1665.wav,pending
One could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books.,english/english-sample1666.wav,pending
"Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the names of streets—anything that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered.",english/english-sample1667.wav,pending
"“I never knew it had been a church,”",english/english-sample1668.wav,pending
he said.,english/english-sample1669.wav,pending
"“There’s a lot of them left, really,”",english/english-sample1670.wav,pending
"said the old man, “though they’ve been put to other uses.",english/english-sample1671.wav,pending
"Now, how did that rhyme go?",english/english-sample1672.wav,pending
Ah!,english/english-sample1673.wav,pending
I’ve got it!,english/english-sample1674.wav,pending
"‘Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St.",english/english-sample1675.wav,pending
"Clement’s, You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St.",english/english-sample1676.wav,pending
"Martin’s—’ there, now, that’s as far as I can get.",english/english-sample1677.wav,pending
"A farthing, that was a small copper coin, looked something like a cent.”",english/english-sample1678.wav,pending
“Where was St.,english/english-sample1679.wav,pending
Martin’s?”,english/english-sample1680.wav,pending
said Winston.,english/english-sample1681.wav,pending
“St.,english/english-sample1682.wav,pending
Martin’s?,english/english-sample1683.wav,pending
That’s still standing.,english/english-sample1684.wav,pending
"It’s in Victory Square, alongside the picture gallery.",english/english-sample1685.wav,pending
"A building with a kind of a triangular porch and pillars in front, and a big flight of steps.”",english/english-sample1686.wav,pending
Winston knew the place well.,english/english-sample1687.wav,pending
"It was a museum used for propaganda displays of various kinds—scale models of rocket bombs and Floating Fortresses, waxwork tableaux illustrating enemy atrocities, and the like.",english/english-sample1688.wav,pending
“St.,english/english-sample1689.wav,pending
"Martin’s-in-the-Fields it used to be called,”",english/english-sample1690.wav,pending
"supplemented the old man, “though I don’t recollect any fields anywhere in those parts.”",english/english-sample1691.wav,pending
Winston did not buy the picture.,english/english-sample1692.wav,pending
"It would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were taken out of its frame.",english/english-sample1693.wav,pending
"But he lingered for some minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not Weeks—as one might have gathered from the inscription over the shop-front—but Charrington.",english/english-sample1694.wav,pending
Mr.,english/english-sample1695.wav,pending
"Charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years.",english/english-sample1696.wav,pending
"Throughout that time he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had never quite got to the point of doing it.",english/english-sample1697.wav,pending
All the while that they were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept running through Winston’s head.,english/english-sample1698.wav,pending
Oranges and lemons say the bells of St.,english/english-sample1699.wav,pending
"Clement’s, You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St.",english/english-sample1700.wav,pending
Martin’s!,english/english-sample1701.wav,pending
"It was curious, but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost London that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten.",english/english-sample1702.wav,pending
From one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth.,english/english-sample1703.wav,pending
Yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing.,english/english-sample1704.wav,pending
He got away from Mr.,english/english-sample1705.wav,pending
"Charrington and went down the stairs alone, so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before stepping out of the door.",english/english-sample1706.wav,pending
"He had already made up his mind that after a suitable interval—a month, say—he would take the risk of visiting the shop again.",english/english-sample1707.wav,pending
It was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre.,english/english-sample1708.wav,pending
"The serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place, after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted.",english/english-sample1709.wav,pending
However—!,english/english-sample1710.wav,pending
"Yes, he thought again, he would come back.",english/english-sample1711.wav,pending
He would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish.,english/english-sample1712.wav,pending
He would buy the engraving of St.,english/english-sample1713.wav,pending
"Clement’s Danes, take it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his overalls.",english/english-sample1714.wav,pending
He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr.,english/english-sample1715.wav,pending
Charrington’s memory.,english/english-sample1716.wav,pending
Even the lunatic project of renting the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again.,english/english-sample1717.wav,pending
"For perhaps five seconds exaltation made him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window.",english/english-sample1718.wav,pending
"He had even started humming to an improvised tune—Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St.",english/english-sample1719.wav,pending
"Clement’s, You owe me three farthings, say the—",english/english-sample1720.wav,pending
Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water.,english/english-sample1721.wav,pending
"A figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten metres away.",english/english-sample1722.wav,pending
"It was the girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair.",english/english-sample1723.wav,pending
"The light was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her.",english/english-sample1724.wav,pending
"She looked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him.",english/english-sample1725.wav,pending
For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move.,english/english-sample1726.wav,pending
"Then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction.",english/english-sample1727.wav,pending
"At any rate, one question was settled.",english/english-sample1728.wav,pending
There was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him.,english/english-sample1729.wav,pending
"She must have followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet, kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived.",english/english-sample1730.wav,pending
It was too great a coincidence.,english/english-sample1731.wav,pending
"Whether she was really an agent of the Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly mattered.",english/english-sample1732.wav,pending
It was enough that she was watching him.,english/english-sample1733.wav,pending
Probably she had seen him go into the pub as well.,english/english-sample1734.wav,pending
It was an effort to walk.,english/english-sample1735.wav,pending
"The lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away.",english/english-sample1736.wav,pending
The worst thing was the pain in his belly.,english/english-sample1737.wav,pending
For a couple of minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon.,english/english-sample1738.wav,pending
But there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this.,english/english-sample1739.wav,pending
"Then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.",english/english-sample1740.wav,pending
The street was a blind alley.,english/english-sample1741.wav,pending
"Winston halted, stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace his steps.",english/english-sample1742.wav,pending
As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her.,english/english-sample1743.wav,pending
"He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone.",english/english-sample1744.wav,pending
The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job.,english/english-sample1745.wav,pending
"But he abandoned the idea immediately, because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable.",english/english-sample1746.wav,pending
"He could not run, he could not strike a blow.",english/english-sample1747.wav,pending
"Besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself.",english/english-sample1748.wav,pending
"He thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening.",english/english-sample1749.wav,pending
But that too was impossible.,english/english-sample1750.wav,pending
A deadly lassitude had taken hold of him.,english/english-sample1751.wav,pending
All he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet.,english/english-sample1752.wav,pending
It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat.,english/english-sample1753.wav,pending
The lights would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty.,english/english-sample1754.wav,pending
He went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin.,english/english-sample1755.wav,pending
"Then he went to the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer.",english/english-sample1756.wav,pending
But he did not open it at once.,english/english-sample1757.wav,pending
From the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song.,english/english-sample1758.wav,pending
"He sat staring at the marbled cover of the book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness.",english/english-sample1759.wav,pending
"It was at night that they came for you, always at night.",english/english-sample1760.wav,pending
The proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you.,english/english-sample1761.wav,pending
Undoubtedly some people did so.,english/english-sample1762.wav,pending
Many of the disappearances were actually suicides.,english/english-sample1763.wav,pending
"But it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and certain poison, were completely unprocurable.",english/english-sample1764.wav,pending
"He thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed.",english/english-sample1765.wav,pending
He might have silenced the dark-haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough:,english/english-sample1766.wav,pending
but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act.,english/english-sample1767.wav,pending
"It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but always against one’s own body.",english/english-sample1768.wav,pending
"Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible.",english/english-sample1769.wav,pending
"And it is the same, he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations.",english/english-sample1770.wav,pending
"On the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.",english/english-sample1771.wav,pending
He opened the diary.,english/english-sample1772.wav,pending
It was important to write something down.,english/english-sample1773.wav,pending
The woman on the telescreen had started a new song.,english/english-sample1774.wav,pending
Her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass.,english/english-sample1775.wav,pending
"He tried to think of O’Brien, for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him away.",english/english-sample1776.wav,pending
It would not matter if they killed you at once.,english/english-sample1777.wav,pending
To be killed was what you expected.,english/english-sample1778.wav,pending
"But before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to be gone through:",english/english-sample1779.wav,pending
"the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth, and bloody clots of hair.",english/english-sample1780.wav,pending
"Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same?",english/english-sample1781.wav,pending
Why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life?,english/english-sample1782.wav,pending
"Nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess.",english/english-sample1783.wav,pending
When once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead.,english/english-sample1784.wav,pending
"Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded in future time?",english/english-sample1785.wav,pending
He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of O’Brien.,english/english-sample1786.wav,pending
"“We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,”",english/english-sample1787.wav,pending
O’Brien had said to him.,english/english-sample1788.wav,pending
"He knew what it meant, or thought he knew.",english/english-sample1789.wav,pending
"The place where there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see, but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in.",english/english-sample1790.wav,pending
But with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further.,english/english-sample1791.wav,pending
He put a cigarette in his mouth.,english/english-sample1792.wav,pending
"Half the tobacco promptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again.",english/english-sample1793.wav,pending
"The face of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing that of O’Brien.",english/english-sample1794.wav,pending
"Just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it.",english/english-sample1795.wav,pending
"The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm, protecting:",english/english-sample1796.wav,pending
but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?,english/english-sample1797.wav,pending
Like a leaden knell the words came back at him:,english/english-sample1798.wav,pending
WAR IS PEACE FREEDOM IS SLAVERY IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH,english/english-sample1799.wav,pending
