en_krishna_001,There was once a merchant who employed many carpenters and masons to build a temple in his garden.
en_krishna_002,"Regularly, they would start work in the morning, and take a break for the mid-day meals, and return to resume work till evening."
en_krishna_003,"One day, a group of monkeys arrived at the site of the building and watched the workers leaving for their mid-day meals."
en_krishna_004,One of the carpenters was sawing a huge log of wood.
en_krishna_005,Since it was only half-done he placed a wedge in between to prevent the log from closing up.
en_krishna_006,He then went off along with the other workers for his meal.
en_krishna_007,"When all the workers were gone, the monkeys came down from the trees and started jumping around the site, and playing with the instruments."
en_krishna_008,"There was one monkey, who got curious about the wedge placed between the log."
en_krishna_009,"He sat down on the log, and having placed himself in between the half-split log, caught hold of the wedge and started pulling at it."
en_krishna_010,"All of a sudden, the wedge came out."
en_krishna_011,"As a result, the half-split log closed in and the monkey got caught in the gap of the log."
en_krishna_012,"As was his destiny, he was severely wounded."
en_krishna_013,"The wise indeed say, One, who interferes in other's work, surely comes to grief."
en_krishna_014,"One day, a jackal called Gomaya was very hungry, and was wandering about in search for food."
en_krishna_015,"After some time, he wandered out of the jungle he lived in, and reached a deserted battlefield."
en_krishna_016,"In this deserted battlefield, a battle was fought recently."
en_krishna_017,"The fighting armies had left behind a drum, which was lying near a tree."
en_krishna_018,"As strong winds blew, the branches of the tree got rubbed against the drum."
en_krishna_019,This made a strange noise.
en_krishna_020,"When the jackal heard this sound, he got very frightened and thought of running away."
en_krishna_021,"If I cannot flee from here before I am seen by the person making all this noise, I will be in trouble."
en_krishna_022,"As he was about to run away, he had a second thought."
en_krishna_023,It is unwise to run away from something without knowing.
en_krishna_024,"Instead, I must be careful in finding out the source of this noise."
en_krishna_025,He took the courage to creep forward cautiously.
en_krishna_026,"When he saw the drum, he realized that it was only the wind that was causing all the noise."
en_krishna_027,"He continued his search for food, and near the drum he found sufficient food and water."
en_krishna_028,"The wise indeed say, Only the brave succeed in life."
en_krishna_029,"In a city called Vardhamana, lived a very efficient and prosperous merchant."
en_krishna_030,"The king was aware of his abilities, and therefore made him the administrator of the kingdom."
en_krishna_031,"With his efficient and intelligent ways, he kept common man very happy, and at the same time he impressed the king on the other side."
en_krishna_032,"Such a person, who can keep everybody happy, is rarely found."
en_krishna_033,"Later, there came a time that the merchant's daughter was getting married."
en_krishna_034,He arranged for a lavish reception.
en_krishna_035,"The merchant not only invited the king and the queen, who obliged by attending, but he also invited the entire royal household and all respected people of the kingdom."
en_krishna_036,"During the reception, he ensured to provide his guests with the best of treatments."
en_krishna_037,He gave out gifts to guests to show them respect for attending to his invitation.
en_krishna_038,"A servant of the royal household, who used to sweep the palace, was not invited but attended the reception."
en_krishna_039,"He took a seat which was reserved for the royal nobles, not meant for common invitees."
en_krishna_040,This made the merchant very angry.
en_krishna_041,He caught him by the neck and ordered his servants to have him thrown out.
en_krishna_042,"The royal servant felt very insulted, and could not sleep all night."
en_krishna_043,"He thought, If I can have the king to disfavour this merchant, I will have my revenge."
en_krishna_044,"But what can I, a common fellow, do to harm a powerful person as him."
en_krishna_045,"Thinking such, he suddenly had a plan."
en_krishna_046,"Several days later, the servant was sweeping the floor near the king's bed early in the morning."
en_krishna_048,"The servant started mumbling, Good heavens! The merchant has become so carefree now that he dared to embrace the queen!"
en_krishna_049,"When the king heard this lying in his bed, he jumped up and asked the servant, Is it true? Have you seen the merchant embrace my queen yourself?"
en_krishna_050,"The servant at once fell at the king's feet, O Master, I was gambling all night."
en_krishna_051,I feel drowsy for I didn't sleep last night.
en_krishna_052,"I don't know what I have been mumbling, but I said anything improper, please forgive me."
en_krishna_053,"The king spoke no more, but the servant knew he had sowed the seed of distrust."
en_krishna_054,"The king thought, It can be true! The servant moves about the palace freely, and so does the merchant."
en_krishna_055,It is possible that the servant has seen something.
en_krishna_056,The king was troubled with jealousy.
en_krishna_057,"From that day onwards, he withdrew his favours from the merchant and even forbade him to enter the palace."
en_krishna_058,"One day, when the merchant was entering the gateway to the palace, he was stopped by the guards."
en_krishna_059,The merchant was surprised due to this sudden change in the king's attitude.
en_krishna_060,"The servant was nearby, and mocking shouted at the guards, Ho Guards! That merchant is favoured by the king, He is a powerful person."
en_krishna_061,"He can have people arrested or released or even thrown out, just like he had me thrown out of his daughter's reception."
en_krishna_062,"Beware, for you may suffer the same fate."
en_krishna_063,"On hearing this, the merchant understood that the servant has caused all this trouble somehow."
en_krishna_064,"He felt dejected, and returned home upset over the incident."
en_krishna_065,"He gave everything a second thought, and then he invited the royal servant to his house."
en_krishna_066,"He treated the servant with utmost respect, and flattered him with gifts and garments."
en_krishna_067,"He said kindly, O friend, that day I did not have you thrown out due to anger, but it was improper of you to occupy the seat reserved for the royal nobles."
en_krishna_068,"They felt insulted, and out of compulsion I had to throw you out. Please forgive me."
en_krishna_069,"The servant was already flattered with all the gifts, and he was full of joy, Sir, I forgive you. You have not only expressed your regrets, but also honoured me with utmost respect."
en_krishna_070,"He ensured the merchant, I will prove you how clever I am."
en_krishna_071,"I will have the king favourable towards you, like he was before."
en_krishna_072,The servant went back home.
en_krishna_073,"Early next morning, when he started sweeping the floors of the palace, he waited till when the king was lying half-awake."
en_krishna_074,"On hearing this, the king was taken aback."
en_krishna_076,Have you ever seen me doing such thing yourself?
en_krishna_077,"Once again the servant fell on his knees and prayed, O Master, please forgive me if I said something improper."
en_krishna_078,"The king thought to himself, I have never eaten a cucumber in the lavatory."
en_krishna_079,What he mumbled about me is ridiculously false.
en_krishna_081,It was improper of me to mistreat the merchant.
en_krishna_082,"He wondered, After all he has been so efficient in the whole administrative system, that without him it has become slack."
en_krishna_083,"Thus, having considered carefully, the king invited the merchant to the palace and flattered him with gifts, jewels and garments."
en_krishna_084,"He re-appointed the merchant to his previously held position, and favoured his services as before."
en_krishna_085,"The wise indeed say, One should treat one and all, even the lowest, with respect."
en_krishna_086,"Once upon a time, there was a sage called Deva Sharma who lived in a temple in the outskirts of a town."
en_krishna_087,He was widely known and respected.
en_krishna_088,"People would visit him, and offer him with gifts, food, money and garments to seek his blessings."
en_krishna_089,"The gifts that he did not need for himself, he would sell off, and got rich on the proceeds."
en_krishna_090,"And by nature, he trusted nobody."
en_krishna_091,"So, he kept all his money in a bag which he carried under his arm all the time."
en_krishna_092,He would not part with the bag for a single moment.
en_krishna_093,"One day, a swindler came across the sage, and he became sure that the bag this holy man was so possessive of, must surely contain a lot of treasure."
en_krishna_094,"He planned on stealing the bag from the sage, but could not think of a way to do so."
en_krishna_095,"He thought, I cannot make a hole in the temple wall, or jump over the high gates."
en_krishna_096,But I can charm him with sweet words to accept me as his disciple.
en_krishna_097,"He wondered, If I can stay with him as a disciple, I can win his confidence. When I get an opportunity, I will rob him, and leave this place."
en_krishna_098,"Having planned so, the swindler approached the holy man with reverence, Om Namah Shivaya! I bow before Lord Shiva, the God of Destruction."
en_krishna_099,"With these words, he fell on the sage's feet and said, O Guruji, Please guide me to the right path of life."
